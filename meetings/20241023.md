## Overall Summary  

### Presentation

**Presenter:** Takashi Ninjouji (Toshiba Corporation)

**Overview:**
- The presentation provided an overview of various regulations and guidelines related to Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and highlighted the differences and similarities between them.
- Key documents discussed included the NTIA's minimum elements for SBOM, CSA's framing of software component transparency, and BSI's guidelines (TR-03182 Part 2).
- The presentation compared the attributes required by these documents and discussed the implications for SBOM quality and future discussions.

**Key Points:**
1. **Regulations and Guidelines:**
   - NTIA's minimum elements for SBOM in the US.
   - CSA's framing of software component transparency.
   - BSI's guidelines (TR-03182 Part 2) in Europe.
   - Other guidelines from Japan, India, and other countries.

2. **Comparison of Attributes:**
   - Differences in required attributes such as SBOM type, component relationships, license information, and end-of-life information.
   - The importance of including certain attributes for specific use cases, such as medical devices and payment card industry standards.

3. **Maturity Levels:**
   - CSA's maturity levels for SBOM, ranging from minimum expected to aspirational goals.
   - BSI's detailed levels, including top-level SBOM, transitive SBOM, and complete SBOM.

4. **Considerations for SBOM Quality:**
   - The need for clear definitions and guidelines for SBOM attributes.
   - The importance of automating SBOM management and ensuring the quality of SBOM data.

### Summary of the Discussion

#### Discussion Point 1: Harmonization of SBOM Guidelines
**Content:**
Participants discussed the need for a single, harmonized set of SBOM guidelines to simplify global software supply chains.

**Results:**
- General agreement on the importance of harmonization and clarity in SBOM types.
- Recognition of the need to align different guidelines and create a unified approach.

**TODOs:**
- Continue discussions to align different guidelines and create a unified approach.

#### Discussion Point 2: Static vs. Dynamic SBOMs
**Content:**
The debate centered around whether SBOMs should be static documents or dynamic API streams, and how to handle VEX information.

**Results:**
- Consensus on maintaining static SBOMs with linked VEX information.
- Recognition of the potential for dynamic API streams in the future.

**TODOs:**
- Develop best practices for linking VEX information in static SBOMs.
- Explore the feasibility of dynamic API streams.

#### Discussion Point 3: Comprehensive SBOMs
**Content:**
The need for a single SBOM containing all necessary information for various use cases was discussed.

**Results:**
- Agreement on the importance of a comprehensive SBOM that can cater to different needs.

**TODOs:**
- Define the necessary information to be included in a comprehensive SBOM.
- Ensure the comprehensive SBOM meets the requirements of different stakeholders.

#### Discussion Point 4: Dynamic Updates for Specific Use Cases
**Content:**
The potential need for dynamic updates in SBOMs for closely integrated architectures and specific contexts like security assessments and export control.

**Results:**
- Acknowledgment of the need for dynamic updates in certain use cases.

**TODOs:**
- Identify specific use cases where dynamic updates are necessary.
- Develop guidelines for implementing dynamic updates.

#### Discussion Point 5: Adhering to Different Standards
**Content:**
The challenge of adhering to various SBOM standards and the need for a unified approach.

**Results:**
- Recognition of the need for ongoing discussions to address different standards and improve SBOM quality and automation.

**TODOs:**
- Prioritize issues related to SBOM quality and automation.
- Continue discussions to create a unified approach to adhering to various standards.

### Opinions and Reactions

1. **Anthony Harrison's Opinion:**
   - **Opinion:** Anthony expressed a desire for a single, harmonized set of SBOM guidelines, emphasizing the importance of sorting out the quality of simple SBOMs before getting too detailed. He also highlighted the importance of specifying the type of SBOM and keeping SBOMs static while having a more dynamic VEX format.
   - **Reactions:** Thomas Steenbergen responded by discussing the two streams of thought regarding SBOMs: static documents and API streams. He supported the idea of linking VEX information rather than including it directly in static SBOMs.
   - **Conclusion:** There was a general agreement on the need for clarity in SBOM types and the separation of static SBOMs from dynamic VEX information.

2. **Thomas Steenbergen's Opinion:**
   - **Opinion:** Thomas elaborated on the two approaches to SBOMs: static documents and API streams. He supported the idea of linking VEX information in static SBOMs and highlighted the potential for continuous communication in API streams.
   - **Reactions:** Jari Koivisto echoed Thomas's points, emphasizing the current preference for static SBOMs and dynamic VEX information.
   - **Conclusion:** The discussion leaned towards maintaining static SBOMs with linked VEX information, while recognizing the potential for dynamic API streams in the future.

3. **Jimmy Ahlberg's Opinion:**
   - **Opinion:** Jimmy supported the idea of a single SBOM containing all necessary information for various use cases and user personas. He emphasized the importance of not catering to multiple customers with different SBOMs.
   - **Reactions:** There was no direct opposition to Jimmy's opinion, and it aligned with the general consensus of having a comprehensive SBOM.
   - **Conclusion:** The group agreed on the importance of a single, comprehensive SBOM that can cater to different needs.

4. **Stephen Pollard's Opinion:**
   - **Opinion:** Stephen inquired about the potential need for dynamic SBOMs in closely integrated architectures.
   - **Reactions:** Ummo Schwarting responded by discussing the relevance of dynamic information for security assessments and export control, suggesting that dynamic updates might be necessary in certain contexts.
   - **Conclusion:** The group acknowledged the potential need for dynamic updates in specific use cases, such as security assessments and export control.

5. **Marc-Etienne Vargenau's Opinion:**
   - **Opinion:** Marc-Etienne questioned the next steps for adhering to different standards and how to proceed with creating a unified approach.
   - **Reactions:** Takashi Ninjouji and Yoshiyuki Ito acknowledged the need for further discussion and prioritization of issues related to SBOM quality and automation.
   - **Conclusion:** The group recognized the need for ongoing discussions to address the various standards and improve SBOM quality and automation.
