00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.419
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Hi, there!

3
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.480
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So I'm just putting a placeholder up. This isn't meant to be the main slides. It's just

4
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.019
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): on the screen, temporarily.

5
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.510
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Oh, shoot!

6
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.680
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): This is just temporary as a placeholder.

7
00:01:29.802 --> 00:01:31.160
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): How are you.

8
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.260
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Oh, sorry! I can't hear you.

9
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.850
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Really, okay.

10
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.020
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Oh, yeah.

11
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.120
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Better, now.

12
00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:42.599
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, I can hear you now.

13
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.380
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Okay, I'm sorry

14
00:01:45.328 --> 00:01:54.529
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): this. This slide is just a placeholder until we get ready and you share your slides. This is just a temporary.

15
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.740
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Oh, thank you!

16
00:01:57.928 --> 00:02:02.590
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So how are you doing with jet lag after.

17
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.330
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): yeah. But our when it comes to back to Japan, we don't have any jet lag.

18
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.850
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Really.

19
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.640
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah.

20
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.550
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): He's saying.

21
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.469
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): you're too strong.

22
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.949
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So really, where where did you be? A Helsinki, or.

23
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.260
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): No, I flew to Paris, and then they flew.

24
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.709
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It sounds.

25
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.550
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yes, and then they flew very south. They took us well down.

26
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.310
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): They took us down to the bottom of the world.

27
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.810
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

28
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.240
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And we we flew

29
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.140
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): comfortable, but long.

30
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.100
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

31
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:59.819
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): so many people, including, of course, for you to be at Helsinky.

32
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.990
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yes.

33
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.320
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So there are no jet lag.

34
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.770
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): That's really good.

35
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.800
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah.

36
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:16.749
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But unfortunately, we I I think some of them ask the code of call.

37
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.256
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): because

38
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.330
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): no, my colleague told a call

39
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.400
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): during the event.

40
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.039
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): After a little time back to Japan some people call like caught a cold.

41
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.590
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): including me.

42
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.200
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yes.

43
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.330
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): one of the things that's, I think one thing that's very different. When we leave Japan

44
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:51.049
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): is in in most of the world, most of Europe and us. There's there's not much alcohol used, and

45
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.269
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): you know people are sick. They're not using masks. So it's very easy to catch a cold.

46
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.360
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah.

47
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.830
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And

48
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.749
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): after living in Japan for many years, I think

49
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.398
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): our immune systems are lower.

50
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.100
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We're not used to getting so many calls.

51
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.230
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): but

52
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.910
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): we certainly had a wonderful adventure.

53
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.350
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and it was amazing to see. Follow up work.

54
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.699
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): for example, to see the

55
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.709
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): follow up S bomb work that you know, Iumi just published

56
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.680
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): that article covering things.

57
00:04:42.385 --> 00:04:43.090
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah.

58
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.960
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yeah.

59
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.880
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): which is exciting. I think.

60
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.310
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): yeah.

61
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.280
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So many asthma activities in Japan.

62
00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:03.679
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And oh, I I guess almost all activities are led by open chain group members.

63
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.210
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I think so. It's always the same. 10 people.

64
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:15.370
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, in automotive industry, endocrine. Lady Endogen laid the asthma activities

65
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.820
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and some kind of public sector.

66
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.280
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): What? Another time made a letter to them.

67
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:30.399
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and about the Spdx. And so I I discuss I lead some discussion.

68
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.900
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): You know.

69
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.580
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And then, yeah.

70
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:43.049
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): This has been very useful for us, because all the people from Spdx are very, I mean, from open chain are very focused on practical

71
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:55.449
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): markets. Yeah. So I feel like in Japan, we made a lot of progress just focusing always, how does it do something today for the this real supply chain?

72
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.290
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yeah.

73
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:10.280
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And of course I I guess I believe you know this event open plan to hold the

74
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.749
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): that's a bummer.

75
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.640
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yes.

76
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.650
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): What is that? Yeah. On November first, st November first, st

77
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.350
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): after compliance, open compliance summit.

78
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.620
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): That's right.

79
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.490
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yeah.

80
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.830
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And.

81
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.590
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): No sorry, Chad.

82
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.760
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Open Conference summit this year.

83
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:42.860
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Our legal colleagues will join the Open Compliance Summit, so I do like to, Strong. I'd like to introduce some people to our colleagues.

84
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.250
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yes, please.

85
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.560
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): In fact. I would love to to do that.

86
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.190
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And for those on the line who are just joining.

87
00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:01.009
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): as you can gather. We're quite excited about a conference that's coming

88
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.919
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): very soon.

89
00:07:03.643 --> 00:07:04.750
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): It's it's

90
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:14.200
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): probably the most important conference now for community legal compliance. This is the Conference, the Open Compliance Summit.

91
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.809
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): It's office.

92
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.349
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But Mark, thank you for joining

93
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:20.435

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:35.929
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So do you want me to hand over to you, Kubota-san, to share slides? Because I know you have a slide deck.

99
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:37.190
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah.

100
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.789
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Okay. And if you want, I can do the

101
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:45.689
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the 1st intro and the antitrust policy notice and then hand over to you for the

102
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.610
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the real discussion. Would that be okay?

103
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.590
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, okay.

104
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.259
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So I'll share my slide.

105
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.559
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Can you see my screen.

106
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.900
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): It's perfect. I can see it. Can everyone else see it?

107
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:06.660
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yep.

108
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.480
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

109
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:14.750
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Okay, I'm seeing we're getting a lot of friends on the line like, now we have. Wow!

110
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.650
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): It seems loads of people from Sony.

111
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.929
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): you must be very yeah. Lots of sony people. You must be very busy with the supply chain for the Ps. 5.

112
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.880
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Everyone's getting ready.

113
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.420
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

114
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.290
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Okay. I'll get curious.

115
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:39.100
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, yeah, it's time to start. And Hello, Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining opencare asthma study group.

116
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:51.819
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And I remember after the Kickoff meeting at the end of July July 13, th I remember, and after that we spend a little bit along time of vacation.

117
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:56.000
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and today we are very happy to hold a fast meeting

118
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.140
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): for the Ethnol Study group.

119
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:02.590
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Oh.

120
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.490
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): wait a moment. Okay.

121
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:24.260
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And 1st of all, as always. And of course it's shown by it's always showed by share. But I'd like to show the anti. And this is an open source community event for the people belonging to belonging to various companies.

122
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.929
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So please do not violate this trust policy.

123
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:35.339
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and although we don't show here this, there is a code of conduct in the next foundation.

124
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.470
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So please follow it, too. Okay.

125
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:50.400
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and this is the agenda for today. 1, st 3 housekeeping, and next to Telco guide introduced by my phone.

126
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.069
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And after that we'd like to discuss about that.

127
00:09:54.370 --> 00:10:02.210
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I know before moving to the housekeeping staff. Shan, could you give some opening message?

128
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:12.680
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Of course. Thank you. Kubota San. So everyone. This is a new study group for the Open chain project. But we are

129
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:21.399
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): building on the shoulders of giants. Openchain has been doing stuff around Sbom since we started.

130
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:33.679
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): The 1st and main requirement that we had in our 1st standard, as we built it in 2,015 and 2,016 was have an S-bomb.

131
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:48.049
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Since then our community around the world has been doing things on this topic, for example, creating Spdx lite. The Japan workgroup did that people on this call

132
00:10:48.673 --> 00:11:03.890
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): like, for instance, Ito-san from Renasus, Ninjoji-san from Toshiba, and of course, Kuboto-san from Sony. Some examples of people who created the Spdx Light Standard and helped

133
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:10.960
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): get that contribution into the Spdx project and their releases.

134
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:25.519
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): That type of work was always very practical. The Spdx Light Standard is designed to help small suppliers. Add a few Sbom tags into things like spreadsheets

135
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:32.180
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): with minimal burden, and then larger companies, like, for example, Sony, or

136
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:45.619
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): looking across the world, a company like Bosch, etc, etc, can quickly take that type of data from small companies and ingest it into bigger, more complete

137
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.919
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): tooling, automation and record keeping.

138
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.329
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We've also created

139
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:58.610
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): determination of what's good around Sbalm. Again, totally practical.

140
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.690
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): The Telco Work group of the Open Chain project

141
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:08.200
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): created an Sbom guide, and it's called the Telco Sbom Guide.

142
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:16.199
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): But what it does is much more than talk about something for Telco per se.

143
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:29.610
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): This Sbom Guide asks and answers the question, if we're companies in the supply chain, we want to trust the supply chain we want to deal with, let's say, compliance.

144
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.750
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): but also regulatory requirements.

145
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:40.950
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): What is it that we need for an Sbom to say? This is of good enough quality to meet our goals.

146
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:49.729
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): The Telco Sbom Guide describes what's a quality, Sbom, to meet the goals of compliance and meet the goals of

147
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.960
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Ntia regulation.

148
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.820
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): You'll find out more. Marc Etienne, who's the chair of Telco.

149
00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.509
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We'll talk about that now. He's from Nokia.

150
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.480
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and his colleague Gurgley is on the line.

151
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:09.620
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and they've done much more than just the guide. They continued into

152
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:18.980
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): some automation, some validation. And that's where we had Nokia. Release something around validation. No doubt that'll be talked about later.

153
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.669
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and other companies like Bytedance in China, have been

154
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.779
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): contributing schemas and blah blah. All these things.

155
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.769
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): long story short.

156
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.150
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): open chain

157
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:39.189
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): has a vision of a more trusted supply chain for open source

158
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.089
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and the topics

159
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:45.690
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): of compliance all types of compliance

160
00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:53.600
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): in Sbom. We've been using it as a tool, and we've been thinking, how do you use this tool

161
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:56.290
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): in the real supply chain

162
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.290
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): without

163
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.209
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): breaking things without disrupting things?

164
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.110
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): How do we make sure we increase efficiency for the real problems today.

165
00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.239
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): That's what this study group's about. Bringing it all together.

166
00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:16.699
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We study the topic. And in the future we may build new things around the topic.

167
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.760
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Kabodistan is our chair.

168
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:27.420
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): but this is a group like every other we've done. Everyone is welcome to take part.

169
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:31.690
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): contribute share ideas, and help us build more.

170
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:36.430
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I'm sure the topic today is just one of many. For instance.

171
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:41.589
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I mentioned this schema from bytedance thinking about quality S-bomb

172
00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:48.880
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): that was created by a very cool engineer who's done all of that work in his spare time

173
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:56.030
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Bosch is announcing. It's going to release validators and schemas for things like what if there's different formats of Sbom?

174
00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.470
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): How do I think about quality? Here

175
00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.399
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): we have a lot to do.

176
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:09.159
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And today is the official start. So you know Kubota, Sam. Thank you so much. And Mark Etienne, thank you

177
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.519
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and audience. Thank you.

178
00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:19.620
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Handing over, I think now to Kabodistan, who will hand over to Marquetian, and then we'll have the presentation.

179
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.860
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, thank you. Chan.

180
00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:30.989
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And before starting the math session. Can I explain a short housekeeping stuff?

181
00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:53.069
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And then you have a okay. Short budget you have already seen. Being notified about the recording. This workshop is only coded, and this study groups meeting is being held at a convenient time for European and Asia, Asia, especially for Japan. And since there are a few participants from the Us.

182
00:15:53.120 --> 00:16:02.389
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Whereas from discussions, are barely active, so we'd like to provide direct codings and meeting notes and for future discussions with them

183
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:09.409
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): also for efficiency meeting notes are generated by Llm. From the transcript of the recording.

184
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:29.850
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So if there are any privacy issues, and so on, please let us know we will improve some situations. And now this page is based on the results of the last meeting. The purpose of this study group is to share information about the practical use of S bomb, as she described, explained.

185
00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:42.100
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and also for why? In order to find the issues once a month, in about an hour, we will be introduced to actual case studies and exchange opinions on them.

186
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:52.010
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and we have created a dedicated Github Repository and the old materials, and 9 min of the workshop will be shared there.

187
00:16:52.180 --> 00:17:02.700
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and we also have a slack and a mailing list for discussion. Please use as needed, and of course we will post the event information there. As well.

188
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:12.940
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, that's all from my housekeeping stuff. So okay, Max, could you share start your presentation.

189
00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.050
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Yes, I will share my screen.

190
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.779
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Okay. So now you should see my screen.

191
00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:27.660
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): It looks great.

192
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:32.299
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Okay, so let's go in

193
00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:37.890
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): full screen mode. So yes, as Shane

194
00:17:38.924 --> 00:17:45.819
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): already said, I'm from Nokia, and I'm currently leading the open site.

195
00:17:46.947 --> 00:17:50.379
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Telco work work group.

196
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.879
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So I will

197
00:17:54.110 --> 00:18:02.570
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): explain what this work group is about. Then we'll discuss the main result of the work group. That is the

198
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.969
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): open china Intelco respond guide will

199
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:12.489
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): describe the content of the guide. And lastly, we'll

200
00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.920
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): talk about validator.

201
00:18:17.546 --> 00:18:18.420
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): And so

202
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:26.989
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the Telco Work group was formed in May 2,021

203
00:18:27.808 --> 00:18:35.191
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we were vision that was to have an industry alignment on as bomb

204
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.850
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): because we considered that

205
00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:45.949
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): as bomb fragmentation is bad that people from different

206
00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.709
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): companies have different ideas

207
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.560
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and provide different kind of S bombs, so that we'll have

208
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.423
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): cost and

209
00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.460
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): cost implications.

210
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:07.839
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): And we also thought that having a Ness bomb format

211
00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:15.009
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): is not a competitive advantage. So what we wanted was to define

212
00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:21.129
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): water quality as bomb is for the telco industry

213
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:26.240
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and defined it as precisely as as possible.

214
00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:32.740
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): And the 3rd goal we we wanted to follow

215
00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:36.460
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): best practices in the in the industry

216
00:19:37.606 --> 00:19:44.580
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and so the goal was to define the content of the S bomb

217
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.625
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): was also

218
00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:55.810
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): How it should be handled, so how and when it should be distributed.

219
00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:00.487
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So the Telco Work group was

220
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:07.240
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): 1st chat by Jimmy Albert from

221
00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:15.399
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Ericsson, and when he moved to other responsibilities in the open China project

222
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:19.930
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): I took took the lead on it. But I

223
00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:24.449
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): I want to thank him for for starting this

224
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.150
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): this project.

225
00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:30.376
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So

226
00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:44.219
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): The way of working is that everyone is allowed to join, to, to join, as she had mentioned, and to

227
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:52.390
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): to give ideas to give comments. And it's really a work by consensus.

228
00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:58.329
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): We had much discussions about the content, and so it's why it took

229
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.510
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): a bit of time to

230
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.049
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): to get to a stable version.

231
00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:10.269
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So we meet once a month. We have a call on the 1st Thursday of the month.

232
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:16.510
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): We have 2 session, one in the morning for

233
00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:21.308
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): European and Japan.

234
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:27.220
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): inconvenient time zone. And then one in the

235
00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:31.829
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): afternoon, so that the Us. Participants can

236
00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.290
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): can join.

237
00:21:34.036 --> 00:21:35.268
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): We have

238
00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:39.810
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): oops. Oops. Sorry

239
00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:44.499
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): one. Okay, we.

240
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:59.289
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): We have a big and small companies have who have joined. So I've listed some of them. You see, some big telecom companies, but also some

241
00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:03.920
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): companies from other industries and

242
00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:11.090
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): smaller companies like Smart Talk Beacon.

243
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.290
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and also some individual contributors.

244
00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.779
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): And so we had

245
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.490
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): a big number of of contributors.

246
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.640
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): so to to share ideas from from

247
00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.430
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): different parties.

248
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:41.260
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So as a result of the work with this open shine, Telco Spom guide.

249
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:57.059
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So we have approved it internally into Work Group last September.

250
00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.190
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and then it was

251
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:09.070
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): abroad to the open China Steering Committee to make it an official open China document.

252
00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.540
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So in this link you see the

253
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:21.030
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the announcement by Shane in in the open China website.

254
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:26.700
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So to get more

255
00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:35.280
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): availability of the guide, it has been translated in in several languages.

256
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:40.480
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So one Japanese translation from

257
00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:47.800
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): a person from Klidi corporation, I translated it to French, and

258
00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:51.780
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): there is also a Chinese version.

259
00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:54.710
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So

260
00:23:55.690 --> 00:24:03.640
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): you have text versions in the open chain.

261
00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:14.480
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Github Repository, and Shane has created a ready to print Pdf version, which looks a bit nicer.

262
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.620
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): That is that is also available. And

263
00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:27.809
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): so also translation should also be prepared in in Pdf format. But it's not. It's not yet done.

264
00:24:29.201 --> 00:24:32.609
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So, as it is already

265
00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:38.409
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): mentioned, but I want to stress that in fact, we had

266
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:46.399
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): lengthy discussions, but we didn't include in the guide

267
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:56.580
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): requirements that are very specific to to Telcos. So it's a guide that even if the name is still

268
00:24:57.249 --> 00:25:04.199
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): contains still, Telco, it can be used by by other industries.

269
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:13.049
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So what is inside the guide?

270
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:20.249
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): We wanted to have something really practical and operational.

271
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.307
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So we have

272
00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:36.600
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): something as precise as possible. So we selected the format, and we selected as pdx.

273
00:25:37.905 --> 00:25:41.604
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): There are several formats

274
00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:53.429
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): in which an S bomb can be expressed. The 2 main formats are Spdx and Cyclone. Dx.

275
00:25:54.437 --> 00:26:00.980
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): For several reasons we we selected the Spdx.

276
00:26:02.275 --> 00:26:06.650
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): One of the reason is that it's

277
00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:10.079
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): it's an iso. It's an Iso standard

278
00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:16.420
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): And also there are some things that are

279
00:26:17.323 --> 00:26:21.480
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): easily more easily expressed in in Spdx.

280
00:26:22.452 --> 00:26:26.609
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So one of the questions was.

281
00:26:27.781 --> 00:26:36.920
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): version number of of Spdx. So we recommend Spdx. 2 dot. 2,

282
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.990
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): which is the Iso version and

283
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:46.859
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): 2 dot 3. That is an updated version.

284
00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:54.510
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): At the time of the discussion. Spdx

285
00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:01.349
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): free was in preparation, but was not yet released.

286
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:05.559
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Now the Spdx free.

287
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:12.739
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): No release is stable and is being sent to

288
00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:17.769
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Iso for a revised Iso Standard. It is also

289
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:22.930
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): send to the Omg the object management group

290
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.710
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): for for publication.

291
00:27:27.336 --> 00:27:31.720
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): But for the moment we are still

292
00:27:34.035 --> 00:27:47.439
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): recommended Spdx to tools currently produce in

293
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:52.090
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): general. Spdx, Spdx, 2.

294
00:27:52.808 --> 00:27:55.519
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): There are no some.

295
00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:02.620
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Some tools like the Yocto project that is now producing Spdx 3.

296
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:10.339
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): But for the moment it's marginal. So for the moment we stick to Spdx. 2,

297
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:16.319
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and we recommend to publish the

298
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:22.509
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): S bomb in Json format or in tag value format.

299
00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:26.050
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): As there are several formats in Spdx, 2,

300
00:28:26.945 --> 00:28:32.089
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Ji zone is format that is generally

301
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:37.340
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): produced by tools and tag value is.

302
00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:42.560
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): it's the most human readable format.

303
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:45.849
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): There exist several

304
00:28:46.985 --> 00:28:52.473
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): tools to convert between the different Spdx format.

305
00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.858
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the easiest way is to use the

306
00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:02.949
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): online tools that are available in the Spx website, or you can download the

307
00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:05.760
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): python or or Java tools.

308
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:10.730
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So that's about why we selected Spdx and

309
00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.799
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the format. So we

310
00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:26.980
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): also wanted to be compliant with the industrial industry and regulatory requirements.

311
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:30.800
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So we include

312
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:35.059
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the anti AI minimum elements.

313
00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:42.699
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and we require the use of the Caesar S bomb types. As you probably know.

314
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:52.690
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Caesar has defined 5 spom types depending when the spom was was generated.

315
00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:04.730
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): so one important thing is that we have different levels of requirements.

316
00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.280
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So some requirements are immersed.

317
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.575
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and

318
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.259
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): other requirements have a shall or should

319
00:30:16.195 --> 00:30:19.770
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): they are less less mandatory. So

320
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:24.710
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we follow the Rfc. That that describes that.

321
00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.500
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So in the document we have a list of requirements.

322
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:35.290
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and then we have some explanation.

323
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:41.190
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): We have for each requirement a verification and reference material.

324
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:46.429
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So people can get more information.

325
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:50.770
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): And we have rational sections that describe

326
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:55.899
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): that describes why we made this this choice.

327
00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:05.809
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So no, let's deep dive insights.

328
00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:19.859
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Content of the the guide. So the 1st thing that must be present in the S bomb is information

329
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.560
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): when the S problem was

330
00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:29.230
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): created and how it was created.

331
00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:38.400
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): We ask that the software tool that has been used must be mentioned

332
00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:43.800
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): with its name, and it's the version.

333
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.440
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So

334
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:53.160
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): that's for the tool. And also we require that the

335
00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:58.620
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): organization that are created via S bomb, the

336
00:32:00.276 --> 00:32:02.389
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): explicitly present.

337
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:07.520
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So and so for the tool. As I said, we

338
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.819
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we require both the tool name and the version.

339
00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.650
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and so also.

340
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:22.529
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): as creation information, we have

341
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:27.920
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): to put the sbon type

342
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:35.560
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): as defined by Caesar. So in Spdx 2, there is no

343
00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:41.119
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): specific field. So we ask that it is put in

344
00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.750
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): in the Creator command field.

345
00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:51.138
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So that was the

346
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:55.340
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): global information for

347
00:32:55.420 --> 00:33:00.700
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the S bomb. Then the software described

348
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.310
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): in

349
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:08.000
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the S bomb is a list of packages

350
00:33:08.993 --> 00:33:15.949
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): so we require a a number of information describing

351
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:17.540
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): packages.

352
00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:21.820
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): so Spdx allows.

353
00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:25.380
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): a more precise

354
00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:37.429
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): description of the software you can include in Spdx information about files.

355
00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:43.200
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and even with more granularity. You can

356
00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:48.800
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): give information for code snippets.

357
00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.130
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): but that is

358
00:33:51.975 --> 00:33:55.720
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): not required by by the guide. We

359
00:33:55.900 --> 00:34:00.750
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we only require to have a a complete list of packages

360
00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:01.835
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and

361
00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:12.740
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the following information for each package, the name, the version the supplier

362
00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:16.999
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): to download location. So the

363
00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:20.960
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the place where you can get the software.

364
00:34:21.958 --> 00:34:25.849
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): A checksum to identify the package

365
00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:30.980
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the license of the package and the copyright text.

366
00:34:32.181 --> 00:34:37.298
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): And the last thing we recommend

367
00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:40.682
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we were should so not the best. But

368
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:44.810
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we recommend that the package should be

369
00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:51.559
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): identified by a package URL, which is also known as a perl.

370
00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.980
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): I have put here a link to the

371
00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:59.100
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): for specification.

372
00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:03.399
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So it's if you don't know what it is.

373
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:07.070
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): It's a specification that was

374
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:13.620
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): created by the community under the umbrella of so

375
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:21.370
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): next big company as the next big company is creating open source

376
00:35:22.468 --> 00:35:28.779
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): tools. So most known, one being scan code.

377
00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.200
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So very

378
00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:36.016
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): they wanted to create

379
00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:43.829
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): universal way to precisely identify a package, because

380
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:47.646
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): so we're already some other

381
00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:55.040
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): ways to to represent a package. But they had some shortcomings. So

382
00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:59.090
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): they created this this package, URL,

383
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:02.930
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and that's what we we recommend to

384
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:06.210
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): to identify the the package.

385
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:12.903
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So now some

386
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:17.279
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): more information on

387
00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:22.519
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): what? So spom should contain.

388
00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:29.939
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So this is the S bomb scope. So we say here that

389
00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:36.690
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the Spom shall contain all open source software that is delivered

390
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:43.369
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): with the product and including all transitive dependencies.

391
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:47.440
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So transitive dependencies meaning

392
00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:54.199
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): so direct dependencies plus the dependencies of these dependencies, etcetera.

393
00:36:56.790 --> 00:37:00.939
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So then we have

394
00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.300
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): less

395
00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:16.049
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): mandatory requirement is that the s per should also contain all all commercial components.

396
00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.946
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): And lastly,

397
00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:30.300
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we stress with a must that if some components are not included

398
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:34.359
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): they must be reported as known unknown.

399
00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:44.989
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So that was about the content of the S bomb itself.

400
00:37:46.248 --> 00:37:52.119
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Then some information about as per delivery.

401
00:37:53.682 --> 00:38:02.180
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So the S bomb shall be delivered no later than the time of the delivery of the software.

402
00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:09.970
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): so it it must be. It must be

403
00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:12.669
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): at at the same time.

404
00:38:14.095 --> 00:38:17.470
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): And how to deliver it.

405
00:38:18.484 --> 00:38:25.030
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So, if possible, the s bomb shall be delivered

406
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:29.600
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): in the same package of

407
00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.019
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the software itself.

408
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:39.509
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): It should be included in the software. But that's not always possible.

409
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:47.450
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): For instance, in cases where? You have embedded software as we

410
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:53.179
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): space is is limited.

411
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:58.279
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and if that's not possible

412
00:38:59.095 --> 00:39:02.154
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we recommend to have

413
00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:08.420
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): a web to- to to be

414
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:11.510
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): available in A, in a website

415
00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:18.449
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and we had a discussion on how long

416
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:26.990
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): this web version should be available, and some people argued that it

417
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.970
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): should be available

418
00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:35.837
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): as long as as the software is is used.

419
00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:43.839
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): but that seems impractical in some cases. So we decided to

420
00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:52.089
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): requires that the S bomb is accessible for one year and a half after the delivery.

421
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:58.793
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): This is based on the 18th month

422
00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:07.069
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): delay, after which, on the open chain

423
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:10.399
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): compliance must be, must be renewed.

424
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:23.370
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So we also have some other recommendations around the spom.

425
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.920
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So we have a recommendation that

426
00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:33.479
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the s bomb should be digitally signed

427
00:40:34.182 --> 00:40:39.510
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): so, to guarantee the integrity of the S bomb.

428
00:40:40.919 --> 00:40:49.010
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): We didn't for the moment, mandate a specific tool

429
00:40:50.234 --> 00:40:52.890
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): for visa signature.

430
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:56.319
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): We in the document we

431
00:40:56.610 --> 00:41:02.560
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): mention 6 store as a possibility, but we do not mandate it.

432
00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:09.369
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Some other recommendations.

433
00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:13.520
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): is about

434
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:18.330
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So number of has bombs.

435
00:41:19.154 --> 00:41:23.440
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): That should be delivered. Sir.

436
00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:26.870
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): are several strategies. When

437
00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:30.400
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): you deliver on this bomb, or

438
00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:37.290
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): you provide a single file, a single Spdx file is. It contains

439
00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:42.570
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the whole software and all its dependencies.

440
00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:53.189
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): another strategy that is allowed here is that you can have an Spdx file

441
00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:57.550
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): for the main software and then.

442
00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:06.970
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): provide additional Spdx files for the dependencies.

443
00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:14.650
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): these other files being referenced from the main file.

444
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:19.950
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): using the Spdx relationship

445
00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:23.040
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): that are available in in Spdx.

446
00:42:24.018 --> 00:42:30.199
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So here we we allow both both ways of working.

447
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:37.449
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): it will. It will depend

448
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:39.665
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): on what we

449
00:42:41.204 --> 00:42:47.079
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): consumer of the S bomb is is asking

450
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:55.669
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): in the document. In the guide we mentioned one

451
00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.606
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): tools that

452
00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:10.590
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): is available to merge several s. Pers. Into one file.

453
00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:16.500
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Since the publication of the Guide, I found another one.

454
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:23.009
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): which is called Sbom Asm, that is, an open source tool provided

455
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:27.490
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): by a company named interlink, and

456
00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:32.840
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): from the different tools I tested, this one seems

457
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:36.770
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the ones that that works best.

458
00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:42.440
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Further recommendation is

459
00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:47.200
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): about confidentiality. So

460
00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:51.953
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): when we ask bomb is,

461
00:43:52.910 --> 00:44:00.249
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): when the software is is provided to to customer.

462
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:03.698
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So software might, of course, be

463
00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:10.090
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): may, of course, have confidentiality rights.

464
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:13.100
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): And so the the s per

465
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:15.250
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): can also

466
00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:18.450
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): be occupied by

467
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:25.079
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): confidentiality rules. What we say here is that

468
00:44:26.492 --> 00:44:29.799
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): if the software

469
00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:35.419
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): can be distribute, redistributed via as per

470
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:38.590
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): should have the same rights, and should be

471
00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:42.880
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): able to be redistributed also.

472
00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:47.720
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So

473
00:44:48.598 --> 00:44:52.289
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): no, we went through the

474
00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:56.839
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): content of the guide. So the last

475
00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:04.537
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): thing I wanted to share with you. Is that there is no

476
00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:13.880
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): a tool to to validate an S form against the guide.

477
00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:15.455
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So

478
00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:28.140
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): that is, that was developed by and myself at Nokia. And so it's a python program

479
00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:34.550
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): that we give to the community is it's licensed

480
00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:38.360
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): under the Apache 2 dot 0

481
00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:45.600
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): license. It's available on the same Github

482
00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:49.440
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Repository as the as the guide.

483
00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:53.820
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): And so we we have.

484
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:55.543
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): We have

485
00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:03.970
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): a version available on Github, and soon we will publish it on

486
00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:09.680
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): pipe I. So it's even easier to to install it.

487
00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:14.719
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So it's it's open source. So we we welcome

488
00:46:16.892 --> 00:46:23.809
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): tickets and improvements in in the form of Github March requests

489
00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:26.180
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): so

490
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:34.309
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and how does it work? So? You just have to

491
00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:42.759
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): provide the Spdx file in any format type value, Jason or other

492
00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:47.579
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): to the tool, and if with a tool

493
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:51.450
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): finds issues in the

494
00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.520
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Spdx file,

495
00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:03.890
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): it will produce a report. So the 1st thing that the tool we've will verify is that

496
00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:10.349
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): if it is a conformant, a valid Spdx file.

497
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:13.791
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So this is done using the

498
00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:19.530
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Spdx python libraries that is available on on Github.

499
00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:24.510
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): and if it's valid we provide

500
00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:31.129
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): some some errors with respect to the to the guide.

501
00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:36.060
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): so it's displayed as a table.

502
00:47:36.767 --> 00:47:40.600
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So here we have a a small.

503
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:43.530
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): a small example. So

504
00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:46.660
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): here you have 3 errors.

505
00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:47.675
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So

506
00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:55.819
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the 1st line is that it. It is not conformant to ntia, because

507
00:47:55.990 --> 00:48:02.580
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): there is for this package Lib held up 2 dot 4, 2.

508
00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:07.199
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): There is no package supplier or package originator.

509
00:48:08.258 --> 00:48:10.622
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): And so

510
00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:15.310
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): for the same package. We have also

511
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:17.623
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): 2 errors.

512
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:20.060
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): no.

513
00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:27.630
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): the checksum is missing, and the supplier is missing. So

514
00:48:29.385 --> 00:48:35.960
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): well, so 1st and 2 errors are are about are about the same.

515
00:48:38.135 --> 00:48:39.510
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So

516
00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:43.769
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): if it's compliant, you

517
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:49.570
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): just have an output telling you that we

518
00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:52.460
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Spx file is compliant.

519
00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:57.709
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So here we have a recursive thing.

520
00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:03.829
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): We are providing bomb

521
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:08.320
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): of the validator itself, and well

522
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:11.810
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we worked so that it is

523
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.240
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): complying to the guide. So

524
00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:18.780
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): it has not been published to the

525
00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:28.450
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): onto the Github. But we will do it soon. So here I must apologize. We provided the software and we provide the

526
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:33.349
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): maybe as well a bit later. But

527
00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:37.510
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): okay, so

528
00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:42.789
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): that was the end of my

529
00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:46.709
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): presentation. So if you have

530
00:49:47.382 --> 00:49:49.390
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): questions, I will be

531
00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.450
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): happy to to answer

532
00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:56.080
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): back to you. Kubatasan.

533
00:49:56.930 --> 00:50:04.200
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you, Mark, from a great presentation. Are there any questions or comments

534
00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:06.930
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): from past? It's pump.

535
00:50:10.991 --> 00:50:12.678
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I have one, I have one.

536
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:15.059
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Go, either please.

537
00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:19.560
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): My question comes from the Open Source Summit, Europe.

538
00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:32.050
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and several people came to me, and they were talking about how now we're beginning to understand clearly ntia requirements.

539
00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:37.000
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): But we have new requirements coming with the Cra.

540
00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:45.119
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And maybe in the future, we have new requirements in perhaps Japan, perhaps China.

541
00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:52.530
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So the basic question is, the current guide covers license compliance, ntia

542
00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:56.269
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): regulation. What's the minimum you need?

543
00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.660
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We'll

544
00:50:57.790 --> 00:51:03.669
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): updates cover the Cra is that something you are thinking about.

545
00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.522
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Honestly, I didn't.

546
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:19.610
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): I didn't think about it for the moment, but yes, we we should. We should look at it

547
00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:30.540
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): cool.

548
00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:34.859
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yari's hand is up, and Yari always has interesting questions.

549
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:39.280
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): So let's see how interesting this is. But the question is

550
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:43.480
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): because, you know, we do have like people from the Telco industry on the call.

551
00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:46.539
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Have you started to implement

552
00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:50.039
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): these requirements to your suppliers? And if yes.

553
00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:52.200
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): what's what's the reaction.

554
00:51:55.222 --> 00:51:57.329
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Yes, I can.

555
00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:02.417
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): I can speak for Nokia. So yes, we

556
00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:11.190
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): We have started implementing the guide at Nokia

557
00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:15.510
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): as the basis our of our spom format

558
00:52:16.362 --> 00:52:30.280
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): so we will use it both internally and require it from our suppliers and provide it

559
00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:33.710
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): it to our customers. So

560
00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:40.351
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we have. We have started implementing it. But

561
00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:46.110
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): it's only the beginning. So not

562
00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:51.280
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): not many reactions. For for the moment.

563
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:58.210
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Anybody else.

564
00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:02.710
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Yummy, you see me still on a call.

565
00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:04.520
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Hmm!

566
00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:05.770
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): No.

567
00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.740
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We may have lost Jimmy.

568
00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:11.110
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Yeah, seems that he's he's not on the call anymore.

569
00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:21.109
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): But yeah, it would be interesting to to let's say, learn, I don't know. 6 months from now, or I don't know 12 months from now that what has been the reaction.

570
00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:26.400
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): and how well they have been able to to fulfill that you know this guide requirement.

571
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:35.740
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Balakrishna had a note about that Balakrishna. Would would you like to jump in and just share your comment?

572
00:53:36.745 --> 00:53:47.129
Balakrishna M: Yes, thank you. Yeah. So I'm wondering how many of these how many of our suppliers would be ready to pro supply such S bonds, you know, or even have a

573
00:53:47.760 --> 00:54:12.129
Balakrishna M: process in place to generate an S bond itself. To, you know. Adhere with the supply chain process we are coming up with, or even the industry standard standard that's that I've set, or that is going to come up with the cra as well. Right? So just wondering. Of course, there's a lot of work happening everywhere, and we are sharing documentation on how everyone can adhere to the new policies, and be self reliant and capable

574
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.845
Balakrishna M: to

575
00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:19.360
Balakrishna M: you know, equip the supply chain with such secure documents.

576
00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:47.540
Balakrishna M: But actually, I have one for question which popped up in popped into my mind right now. So let's say, let's take example of Nokia. It's not a targeted question for Nokia, please. Let's say a company like Nokia is trying to implement this policy now with with with a with a very good in place for keeping in check of supply chain is there also? Invite to suppliers where you would where you would be open to train them on this thing

577
00:54:48.018 --> 00:54:51.200
Balakrishna M: is that being taken? Well, how how is it going.

578
00:54:54.413 --> 00:54:59.849
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Yes, as I said, we are in the process of requiring

579
00:55:00.573 --> 00:55:06.610
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): s bombs from our suppliers. But no, I don't think we have

580
00:55:07.514 --> 00:55:11.800
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): we? We have started training them

581
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:15.609
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): on what they should, what on what they should provide.

582
00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:37.599
Balakrishna M: Right, you know. I I can ask this question to Gary as well. Gary, since you interact with quite a few people right? Do you see a possibility? Where? Where? Where a consumer would be open to educate a supplier on the needed response to secure their supply chain. Has this happened ever before.

583
00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:51.919
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Currently I'm not aware that the companies are doing that, but I don't see why it couldn't happen. But I think in the end to the whole industry. You know. They will

584
00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:56.209
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): need to, you know, be able to provide, and they need to seek, you know.

585
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:59.949
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): the I don't know own ways, or or I don't know if there's some

586
00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:02.999
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): tooling companies coming and helping them out.

587
00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:05.150
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): I think that's something that to be seen.

588
00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:18.430
HMD Global Nokia X30 5G: One comment to this, like I, I see the the value of the of the S Prom guide here because we can educate

589
00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:25.060
HMD Global Nokia X30 5G: for partners using this one guide as as a as a standard, as a baseline for

590
00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:33.109
HMD Global Nokia X30 5G: for the industry. And this is what what? Targeted with the guys for for the tech or industry. That's the that's the power of it.

591
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:38.500
HMD Global Nokia X30 5G: It's not just like Nokia opening, but we are showing to them.

592
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:57.199
Balakrishna M: No, no, no, yeah. That's why I said, it's a open ended question and not targeted in. Okay, I just wanted to know your opinion on that. The thing is the reason why I brought this up is my personal observation is only the large co large scale companies around European region or Japanese region

593
00:56:57.511 --> 00:57:10.610
Balakrishna M: are capable and are willing to provide such as bombs right? But I think about 60% of my, our vendors. They comprise of medium scale companies or small scale companies, and either they are not educated about this particular topic.

594
00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:29.180
Balakrishna M: or they they are not, you know, trained enough to work on this topic right? So this has been my observation. Hence I brought this up to know if any company has a practice which they have implemented already, which I can take as a success story, probably in my next interaction with whichever companies, or in my own company, actually.

595
00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:32.309
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Come on it

596
00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:35.119
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): go ahead.

597
00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:36.330
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah.

598
00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:42.980
HMD Global Nokia X30 5G: So currently, we are working with our procurement to add these clauses into the Orm

599
00:57:43.310 --> 00:57:45.910
HMD Global Nokia X30 5G: contract templates. So it didn't really need

600
00:57:47.142 --> 00:57:48.799
HMD Global Nokia X30 5G: the partners. Yes.

601
00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:51.680
HMD Global Nokia X30 5G: but already started to think about like, Okay.

602
00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:56.220
HMD Global Nokia X30 5G: if you require a nice company, do not get it.

603
00:57:56.950 --> 00:58:08.350
HMD Global Nokia X30 5G: So what do we do? Then? Should we just hide this information, or should we convey the information downstream, saying in our own that, by the way.

604
00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:14.679
HMD Global Nokia X30 5G: there is a whole chunk of components missing from our S. Bomb because we did not receive the S. Bomb

605
00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:16.720
HMD Global Nokia X30 5G: from lots team companies. What

606
00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:18.720
HMD Global Nokia X30 5G: do you think would be the best

607
00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:22.010
HMD Global Nokia X30 5G: way to handle this kind of situations, because I think we will run

608
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:25.580
HMD Global Nokia X30 5G: into this. In the beginning of this journey.

609
00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:34.070
Balakrishna M: Right sounds good works as a temporary solution, I believe.

610
00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:38.650
Balakrishna M: Oh.

611
00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:39.596
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay. And

612
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:45.266
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I'd like to make a comment. I'm Norio kobota from Sonic Group Corporation. And

613
00:58:46.160 --> 00:59:07.029
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): yeah, I. But I think this 3rd question is very interesting, because this defines not only the element itself, but also the definition of the when and how to pass the s. 1 to the suppliers.

614
00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:13.240
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So it has somewhat some kind of a a contract documentation.

615
00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:29.489
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So in in reality, I collaborate with our legal and create a specific contract and provide the con ask the suppliers to provide the s. 1 in specific contract.

616
00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:35.650
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But if the S. Guide or some kind of guidelines existing.

617
00:59:36.195 --> 00:59:39.840
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): We only defer to the the common guideline.

618
00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:48.220
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It's makes us to easier to provide the expo, and it can be education material as well.

619
00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:49.889
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): That's my opinion.

620
00:59:58.940 --> 00:59:59.605
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I.

621
01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:01.769
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Oh, sorry.

622
01:00:02.655 --> 01:00:09.160
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I just wanted to add that, you know it. It takes a while for things to go into the market.

623
01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:14.090
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): For example, we made the Security Iso standard a while back.

624
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:28.319
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and in the beginning we had a couple of companies adopted, and now more and more most recent, publicly announcing was Samsung Sds. Using our Iso standard for open source security.

625
01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.970
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We had

626
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:35.779
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): More submissions come in in the last 2 weeks

627
01:00:35.890 --> 01:00:43.549
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): where more and more companies pick this up. So I think there's always this, this lead in. We bring something to market

628
01:00:43.690 --> 01:00:50.990
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and a few early adopters, and gradually, over time it grows and grows. So part of the

629
01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:53.110
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the game is

630
01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:57.709
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the patience and also the listening to find out.

631
01:00:57.990 --> 01:01:03.800
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): You know, where are people having trouble understanding this, how do we support them? What do they need?

632
01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:06.370
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So I think that the Sbom Guide

633
01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:13.539
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): is already getting a lot of attention. I mean, it's it's fantastic. David from bytedance is on the line, and he made steamer for it.

634
01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:23.440
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): which he just contributed. And we'll be talking more about that. I was just speaking with David about blog posts and doing presentation about this.

635
01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:25.670
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): You know we we had Nokia

636
01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.330
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): lean into this

637
01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:43.220
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): building on what Ericsson had done. Nokia completed it not just completed it, but created a validator. Kddi contributed translations and thoughts and improvements. Now we have bytedance on it, and and this kind of momentum

638
01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:49.180
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): is the starting point, but it takes a while for it to go out into the industry.

639
01:01:49.220 --> 01:02:03.580
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So I think patience is key and being ready to help people with education material, and Yari just said, should we make education material for S-boms for the suppliers? Yes, and I think the guide is

640
01:02:04.405 --> 01:02:08.500
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): correct me if I'm wrong market, Marquethion, but I think the guide is

641
01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:15.799
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the foundation for that, and we can maybe expand the guide and add extra material, etc, etc.

642
01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:22.204
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Yes, yes. One comment I wanted to make is that.

643
01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:27.579
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): as you said, it takes time for things to

644
01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:35.040
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): to be known and used so. Yes, what I would like is that

645
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:44.720
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): there is some stability so that we don't rush to to make an a new version of the guide. But

646
01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:51.699
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): 1st have it implemented and get get feedback from practical user

647
01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:55.500
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): before creating a new version.

648
01:03:04.533 --> 01:03:08.756
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): I also got a question from David.

649
01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:17.730
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): how about AI model scope will open chain tech guide included in the future.

650
01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.390
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So

651
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:26.299
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): for the moment we we didn't discuss that at all.

652
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:36.650
HMD Global Nokia X30 5G: There was, I think we should then stayed in this call.

653
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:40.750
HMD Global Nokia X30 5G: Whatever the answers out of that discussion.

654
01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.013
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So it's like this call is part one.

655
01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:51.529
HMD Global Nokia X30 5G: It's not 0 dot one. Let's it.

656
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:59.859
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): There's there's a saying in English, and I think it's also in Japanese and some other languages.

657
01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:06.209
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): for being a carpenter measure twice cut. Once.

658
01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:07.939
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Prepare carefully

659
01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:10.580
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): no rush. Get it right.

660
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.100
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Hey? I'll say I need

661
01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:27.319
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): other questions to mark France.

662
01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:38.380
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Oh.

663
01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:43.150
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): okay, thank you. All your presentation. What's up?

664
01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.030
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): They're on.

665
01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:48.749
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Think we can finish today's call.

666
01:04:50.410 --> 01:04:53.729
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Are there any additional comments or

667
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:56.210
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): question?

668
01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.409
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, do you have any

669
01:04:59.450 --> 01:05:00.490
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): message.

670
01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:16.029
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I I just want to say, I think this is a great starting meeting. You know, we have a lot to talk about, and the most important thing, Kubota-san. Thank you for bringing people together and everyone.

671
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:28.559
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We really want you to be part of everything we do. You know you are. You are in charge of where we're going with this work to help the supply chain. So

672
01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:53.519
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): please be back for the next meeting. Help us talk about where we go next with these guides, and also learn about things like, for instance, the new, the new schema from bytedance. And we must find out from Bosch exactly what they're up to. And we'll you know, Kubodistan, I understand you plan to continue the educational part of this as well as the

673
01:05:53.570 --> 01:05:57.920
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the discussion about what needs to be built next. At the same time.

674
01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:04.060
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, thank you, Shan.

675
01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:11.370
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And thank you for attending. We'd like to finish this call and see you next meeting.

680
01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:25.540
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Bye, Europe. Goodbye. The rest of Asia. And for those watching. Hi, America.

681
01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:27.640
