00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.130
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Hello, everyone! We're a few minutes out

2
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:29.779
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): before the meeting will start. So what's going to happen now is that we're going to wait, of course, for the meeting.

3
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.859
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Start time. And meanwhile

4
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.740
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I'll be sharing

5
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.139
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): this slide deck

6
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.750
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): just as a placeholder. So in 4Â min we'll officially open.

7
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:56.009
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Okay, everyone. Well, welcome to the 1st meeting of the

8
00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:06.669
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): S bomb study group. This is one of our kickoff meetings, which means it's designed to help set the structure for the future.

9
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.970
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Now this particular meeting will, of course, follow an agenda.

10
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:35.009
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and I will show you that in just a minute. However, first, st I want to display the antitrust policy. Notice. We show this at the beginning of every meeting hosted by the open chain project. The full antitrust policy can be found on the Linux Foundation website.

11
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.229
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): It's designed to make sure that everyone knows how to comfortably interact

12
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.790
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): in this public community space.

13
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:51.790
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): If you're from a Linux Foundation Member Company. You can ask any questions of our Council, Andy, up to Grove.

14
00:06:51.830 --> 00:07:00.439
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): If you're from a company outside of the Linux Foundation, and you have any questions. Please do ask them of your own legal counsel

15
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.560
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): noun.

16
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:17.769
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Just before I dive into the agenda. I'll make a note that there's some new faces on this call, and therefore I'll introduce myself. I'm Shane Cochlan. I'm the general manager of the Open Chain project.

17
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:28.920
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I try to facilitate our various work groups and study groups around the world and to help ensure that our community can communicate effectively.

18
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.889
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Today's meeting of the new S Bombs Study group

19
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:45.099
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): is designed to bring together various conversations, ideas, and thoughts from the open chain community and beyond

20
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:55.559
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the agenda covers 4 items. We will introduce the practical considerations of using S bombs in supply chains.

21
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.679
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We will discuss who these considerations apply to.

22
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:10.429
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We will talk about existing market solutions by having a case study on something called Spdx lite.

23
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:20.870
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): That's an Sbom format, and then we'll have an open discussion on next steps. We'll talk about where we might want to go

24
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.559
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): as a study group.

25
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:30.049
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and how we ensure that the timing and content is always valuable for you.

26
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:37.359
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Now, open chain likes to make sure that everything is kept relatively informal.

27
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:45.200
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and therefore you are most welcome to jump in and ask questions, or similar at any time.

28
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.369
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I'm also giving permission.

29
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:55.669
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): It's been granted now for anyone to unmute themselves and raise a question if they have one

30
00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.060
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): proceeding.

31
00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:04.189
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I'd like to welcome our chair for this year. It's Kobota Sam.

32
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:15.780
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): senior, open source strategist in the Open Source Program office of Sony, a contributor to the open chain Project, Spd. X. Project and beyond

33
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.970
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Kabodisan has many years experience in this field.

34
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:25.279
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and is also one of the board members of the open chain project.

35
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:32.220
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Kaboda San. Thank you very much for being one of the people behind forming this study group.

36
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:39.690
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and also for volunteering to be the chair taking us through this year as we get started.

37
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:49.149
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): kobotasan will be the person presenting the case. Study on Spdx Light in a few minutes.

38
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.309
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Kabotish him! Would you like to say a word or 2.

39
00:09:54.446 --> 00:10:12.690
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): No, I don't have a specific word. But thank you very much. And all attendees, I'd like to. I'm very exciting to discuss about how to use the app on not only Spd, but also back on the account as well. So

40
00:10:13.189 --> 00:10:21.580
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): we I hope we can have a good discussion in this group, a study group. Thank you very much.

41
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.840
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Thank you, indeed. And I would just note

42
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:38.649
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): that on this call we have a great collection of people from all around the world. Just some examples. A good friend of mine from China. Mobile has dialed in from China. Obviously

43
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.190
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): we have attendees dialing in from Germany.

44
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.750
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): from India, from Japan

45
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.590
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and elsewhere.

46
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.080
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): This is great, as it indicates a lot of interest in the topic.

47
00:10:52.210 --> 00:11:01.600
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and it indicates to us that whether people are based in the UK. Or Sweden. Whether people are based in the United States

48
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.230
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): or in Korea.

49
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:10.740
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): everyone is interested in. How do we use S. Bombs in the supply chain?

50
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.570
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And that's what takes us

51
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.880
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): to

52
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:16.869
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): setting context.

53
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:24.719
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Why are we interested in talking about this topic? And there are a few notes about the practical

54
00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.920
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): considerations for software bill of materials in the supply chain.

55
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:43.339
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): One is what is necessary for compliance matters. For example, corporate license, compliance, corporate security, assurance, and other compliance-related topics.

56
00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:57.189
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): The second is what regulations exist. For instance, the United States Executive Order, the N. Tia minimum requirements and the Cyber Resilience Act in the European Union.

57
00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:03.829
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and then, finally and very importantly, what's necessary for efficiency

58
00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:12.489
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): addressing compliance and regulations is one thing, but this businesses have to make sure that they keep their overheads low.

59
00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.760
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and they ensure that suppliers can realistically meet

60
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.860
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): S bomb requirements.

61
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.610
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Our topic, therefore, is very much focused on.

62
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.559
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): How do we get this done?

63
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:31.720
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): How do we get the compliance stuff and the regulatory stuff done in the context of the real

64
00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.240
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): practical, and occasionally messy market.

65
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.790
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): The second point

66
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:43.379
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): who these considerations apply to is one of the most simple.

67
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:47.469
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): From the perspective of the parties behind this study group

68
00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.440
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the question of How

69
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.419
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): is everyone using the open source supply chain.

70
00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.269
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Whether people are using a format like Spdx

71
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.420
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): or an in-house format for Sbom.

72
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.750
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): or an alternative industry

73
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.839
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): or international standard like cyclone.

74
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.529
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): whether people are a supplier or a customer.

75
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.380
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): whether people are from a big company or a small company.

76
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:25.450
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): These considerations of compliance, regulation, and efficiency

77
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.700
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): apply

78
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.450
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): to everyone.

79
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:40.360
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Now we're going to jump into the case, study that Kobota-san has kindly prepared. But I did notice that we have one question from Sandra.

80
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.760
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Have we decided on a schedule for this meeting.

81
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.310
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): When do we meet

82
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:51.870
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): from now onwards? It's a great question, Sandra.

83
00:13:51.970 --> 00:14:01.139
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We will address that during the open discussion on next steps, which will happen after Kobota Sen's presentation.

84
00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.570
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): But the short version is.

85
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:09.760
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): we basically expect to set a regular meeting schedule from September onwards.

86
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.520
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We're starting this study group at the end of July, just before the big August break.

87
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.950
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): To help get the feedback, we need to set a regular meeting

88
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.779
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): for the September onward period

89
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:27.340
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): right

90
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.109
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): existing market solutions.

91
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.900
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): How is not

92
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:39.100
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): an empty question or speculation? We are doing things in the open source supply chain

93
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.860
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): with software bill of materials.

94
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.979
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): both for license compliance.

95
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:51.290
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and for regulatory compliance matters. There are very practical solutions out there

96
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:55.560
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): that are helping to address the challenges of real companies. Today.

97
00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:01.710
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): we're going to have a case study on Spdx Lite

98
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.940
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): as an example of a practical solution

99
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.489
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): that addresses the question

100
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:08.550
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): of

101
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.870
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): what type of approach

102
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.089
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): can empower suppliers to get started with Sba.

103
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.050
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the context being

104
00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.130
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): that suppliers have limited resources.

105
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.739
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Both suppliers and customers

106
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:25.169
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): need minimal

107
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.860
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): oops. And I see a typo there

108
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:32.589
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): need minimal adjustment to deployment processes.

109
00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:36.660
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and time is extremely limited for everyone.

110
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:45.920
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So, Kobota-san, I'm going to hand over to you for the case study on how Spdx addresses the limited resources.

111
00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.690
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): minimal adjustment

112
00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:55.649
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and limited time questions in the real world. As our 1st case study in the Sbaum study group.

113
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:06.049
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, thank you. Sharing. I do like to share my screen. And could you see my

114
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:07.960
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): video

115
00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.410
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): data moment?

116
00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.170
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Can you see my screen.

117
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.630
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Currently we cannot see your screen.

118
00:16:24.208 --> 00:16:29.139
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I can see your video, but your screen sharing does not be active at the moment.

119
00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.610
Alexios Zavras (Intel Corporation): It works for me.

120
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:31.780
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Okay.

121
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.560
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): In that case it might just be my end.

122
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.660
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

123
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.280
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Everyone.

124
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.850

Arun Azhakesan: I can see that.

127
00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:43.850
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Great.

128
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:52.346
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, if you have any trouble, please let me know in the chat box. I'll check it.

129
00:16:53.525 --> 00:17:03.550
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay. Hello! And thank you for giving me the opportunity to present today. And I'm Norio Cota from Sony Group Corporation.

130
00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:09.199
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But today I present as a member of open project, Japan working group.

131
00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:14.020
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and to kick off who does one study group?

132
00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:16.835
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And today,

133
00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:23.059
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So today, I'd like to introduce our efforts and objectives

134
00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.609
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): regarding f, 1, especially Svdx.

135
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:35.009
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And I think the near future after the September. And I'd like to discuss issues

136
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:39.849
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): to effectively utilize sbone in the actual software supply chain

137
00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:49.379
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): for that purpose. I would be happy if many of you could introduce your issues and the actual activities

138
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.020
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): in this study group.

139
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:52.500

141
00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:08.400
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): The form button, Spd. X point 2.2. I remember the Spd X specification has an annex

142
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.559
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): for X Edx slide

143
00:18:11.698 --> 00:18:18.550
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): it is a cooperation from the Spdx project member like Alex show. Thank you very much.

144
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:26.780
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And Fbd. X. Light is the result of the discussions within the open change upon community.

145
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:34.720
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): on how to effectively, effectively deliver software information across complex software supply chain

146
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:39.660
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and the leads out of the contribution to the Spx project

147
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:50.010
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and in our use case, the key to the sbone is a timing of less shift and distribution.

148
00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:57.770
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And let's think about the intake timing here

149
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:02.569
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and upstream companies in the software supply chain.

150
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:10.140
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): there are still quite a few companies that are not used to working with open source software

151
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.360
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and more Sbom.

152
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.329
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And what happens in this case.

153
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:22.810
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): as you can imagine, they simply

154
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:27.019
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): downloaded the original Floc code from Github

155
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:34.530
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and generate Sbom with some sea tools. This is a facility

156
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:36.980
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): methods

157
00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.109
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): then, but in this case

158
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.760
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): the package name is the hard name.

159
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:51.149
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and the licensing information is generated with a completely meaningless body. No obsession.

160
00:19:52.560 --> 00:20:00.449
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): of course, this is an extreme example, but the information output by these tools.

161
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:01.700
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Barney.

162
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:09.170
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and it also happens that the information we want is not provided. In many cases

163
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:20.509
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): the idea is for upstream companies to generate and provide a complete platform.

164
00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.370
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It's true.

165
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:26.000
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and we are working to achieve that.

166
00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:33.699
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But it will take a little while for every company in the world to do that. I think

167
00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.530
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): so. Therefore, in reality.

168
00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.010
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): when an estimate we received

169
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.930
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): knowledgeable engineers or teams analyze the details

170
00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.540
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): with south calls or metadata on the phone.

171
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.729
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I think it is current reality.

172
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.669
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And then let's think about the distribution timing

173
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:00.910
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): 'kay.

174
00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:04.350
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And in many cases

175
00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:11.010
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): the software we distribute is a part of our commercial product or services.

176
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:18.420
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And we we, our company, is responsible for that product and services.

177
00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.500
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And when something goes wrong.

178
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.749
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Our customers rarely look into the details of the software

179
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.400
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and fix it.

180
00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:35.640
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): The information they need is what the problem is

181
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.060
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and how it is affected.

182
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.480
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And when it will be fixed.

183
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.790
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I think, isn't it

184
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:54.810
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): so with communities and companies at various Som levels or open source. Yeah, software maturity levels

185
00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:58.150
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): composing complex software supply chain.

186
00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:03.080
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So we believe that Xbom is a common language

187
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.800
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): for passing necessary information.

188
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:08.799
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): the necessary inputs.

189
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.540
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So specifications, Hatcher.

190
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:17.009
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): which properties should be written in which format

191
00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:22.019
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and what values should be written in the S. Bone

192
00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:26.049
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): should improve to interoperability

193
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.099
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and facilitate information. Distribution.

194
00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:40.559
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): In this regard we believe open change upon community believe that standardizing Spd. X. And cyclone Dx is barely meaningful.

195
00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:48.650
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And Spd. X. Right has always been designed from the

196
00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:54.070
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): point of review of what kind of minimum information we need

197
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:57.769
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): to be able to do detailed analysis

198
00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.220
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and who feel our responsibilities as a commercial company.

199
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:11.550
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So let me introduce the Spd. X, right in Spd. X. 3, dot. O.

200
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.949
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Sbdx. Light is essential

201
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.620
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): design for license compliance.

202
00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:23.319
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): while are the hearing to the whole Fbd expert.

203
00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.049
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So what's point?

204
00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.910
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This there is no difference in mandatory property.

205
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.430
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): However, some items are specified what to like.

206
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.440
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and let's click on delete

207
00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:42.570
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): providing right-hand information is not mandatory. In 3.org spec.

208
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.800
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But the like right profile requires. Then

209
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:54.080
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): 3rd point is, there are some properties that should be held in as much as possible

210
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:55.640
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): recommendation

211
00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:58.410
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): as many of you know.

212
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:02.500
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): license compliance task is very hard

213
00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.480
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and a time-consuming fact.

214
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:11.680
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So they're not mandatory. But it would be better to write for reducing

215
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.060
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): these air hosts

216
00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:17.159
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and everything else is optional.

217
00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.300
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): These are the Fvx light design principle.

218
00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:29.830
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So here's the overview data structure. For like a profile

219
00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:32.310
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): very simplified.

220
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:38.599
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And we basically think that patching package level information correctly

221
00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.830
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): is the most important thing.

222
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:44.580
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and the part of that holds a detailed analysis

223
00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:55.549
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and what what to look into at the each of the specifications will like to provide

224
00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:01.170
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): the information for the Sbdx document graph.

225
00:25:01.894 --> 00:25:04.150
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): We want to know.

226
00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.549
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): We want to know is

227
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.150
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): who created the document.

228
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.590
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and if what it contains.

229
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:20.609
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): other other properties are recommendation or required by original spec

230
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:28.189
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and F bomb graph is the same as the SDK document correct

231
00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:33.139
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and upholds a creation information craft

232
00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.419
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): it should include who created

233
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:39.870
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and when it was created.

234
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.800
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And this is a recommendation

235
00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:48.699
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): also. We also recommend to include creators email address.

236
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:57.850
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It is actually, we think it is somewhat useful to provide the email information. When we met some troubled.

237
00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:02.460
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): we can contact easily by using this email address.

238
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:07.970
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And this is a package information.

239
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:09.900
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): We

240
00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.570
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): think it is important to include package name.

241
00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:16.120
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): kind of package version.

242
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:18.519
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and who created the package.

243
00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:21.590
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and who provided this package.

244
00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:28.059
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and where it originated are the mandatory properties.

245
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.510
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Go.

246
00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:34.349
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Sometimes the package doesn't have package. Ui.

247
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:39.570
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): so download the location. What package you are in should be.

248
00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:40.590
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I'll

249
00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:42.080
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): described.

250
00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:45.610
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and of course, license compliance.

251
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:50.260
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It's mandatory to write copyright and notice copyright status.

252
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:51.860
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Anna.

253
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:56.100
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): to associate with license information

254
00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.619
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): by using a relationship object.

255
00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:02.660
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And it

256
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:07.000
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I've explained the right profile specification so far.

257
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:13.240
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But I think it's a little hard to understand just watching specification.

258
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.800
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So we created a simple sample

259
00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:23.250
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): to verify that it can be used in our use case.

260
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:29.460
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And ask Spds people, is it correct or not?

261
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:36.640
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So you can refer these samples from the this. Yeah, URL,

262
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:44.599
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and of course, recent Earth bombs require discussions on acuity.

263
00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:54.189
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So we have created samples and discuss if there are any issues or challenges when using respect

264
00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.939
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): as a security profile.

265
00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.899
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and we send the actual sample as a full request

266
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.500
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): to the Fbds community

267
00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:07.180
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and or levied by the Spd. X. Engine.

268
00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:10.889
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): As far as I know.

269
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:16.939
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): very few Jphone examples with Sbdf. 3 dot O. Published.

270
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.060
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): so we hope you will find this somewhat useful.

271
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:32.649
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and the Spd. X lights have been used by several other Japanese companies since budget 2.2,

272
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:35.679
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and they have the most identity

273
00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.339
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): with Asia at here in the past.

274
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:41.610
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and it

275
00:28:43.250 --> 00:29:01.519
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I can't paste the photo on the phone. But in the least hand open change Japan. All member meeting we got Satabe. What type of SS. Bomber do you use in the in your company

276
00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:02.909
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and a

277
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:08.390
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): some of its companies in Japan? Use the Spd X, right? Actually.

278
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:16.379
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And the topic plays out the way we release the zoom in the open chain project, Japan group, Github.

279
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:21.310
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So if you are interested in. Please let me please let me know.

280
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:25.390
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I'll share the material later.

281
00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:33.130
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And I've heard that Spd explodes popular among legal and intellectual property people

282
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:39.249
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): because they can process the Fbum information in a spreadsheet on.

283
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:50.469
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): but in after version 3. It is a little difficult, because it is difficult to handle in the spread of it.

284
00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:55.159
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But we will continue to discuss among the option Japan community

285
00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:00.350
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and compiled with Sbdx people later, I think.

286
00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:03.260
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and at the last

287
00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:11.700
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): thank you for Spd X project team, including today's attendees. Alexia. Thank you very much.

288
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:29.110
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): The Spd team set up an agile call once a month, because the Spd X Tech meeting or some other meetings are held in us and European time. So it is a little difficult to for agent Asian people.

289
00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:36.950
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah. But thank you very much, and that's all from my presentation. Thank you very much.

290
00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:43.609
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Are there any questions?

291
00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.030
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I'll comment.

292
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:53.789
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And, of course a a reminder that anyone is welcome

293
00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:58.100
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): to ask a question, either by unmuting or by typing it.

294
00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:04.840
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So, Kubota San, I just have a very brief one, which is

295
00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:06.640
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): related to

296
00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:11.410
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the length of time it took to develop Spd X slide.

297
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:17.649
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So it's it seems to have been around now for quite a few years. Did it take a long time to create it?

298
00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:26.210
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Haven't.

299
00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:31.570
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): The discussion occurred in 2018.

300
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:34.970
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I'm the

301
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:38.780
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): this custom

302
00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:42.650
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): about the one year among the Japanese

303
00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:44.290
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): commensurate

304
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:52.310
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and Fukusha from Sony group, I'll find, reach out the Spd X specification

305
00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:54.430
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): at A.

306
00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:00.320
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This is similar discussion. There are many similar discussion in the world.

307
00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:10.889
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): but we decided it would be better to contribute existing project other than discussing only us only Japan community.

308
00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:17.030
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And we continue to discuss and contribute to other

309
00:32:17.687 --> 00:32:19.510
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): community Sbdc project.

310
00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:24.040
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So I think it would be better wait.

311
00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:31.339
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This time we created as some study group here. But if there are more.

312
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:38.750
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): better price as a price we will. We have. I'm happy to join as a price.

313
00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:44.109
Arun Azhakesan: Yeah. Hello. I don't hear.

314
00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:52.550
Arun Azhakesan: Kobataasan. I have a question to you. So from the Japanese working group, do you have any experience on

315
00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.580
Arun Azhakesan: the usage of Cyclone Dx.

316
00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.929
Arun Azhakesan: With with any organizations.

317
00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.201
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you for the question.

318
00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:11.059
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): some of us, some of the members in Japan communities have the knowledge about the type one Dx.

319
00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:20.409
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But I'm not sure. And we didn't have the discussion about the cyclone, Dex, so far.

320
00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:31.600
Arun Azhakesan: Okay. So an add, I don't question here to Kobota, son or or Shane here. So in this study working group, are we limiting it to

321
00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:40.090
Arun Azhakesan: Spx and expedite light? Or are we also exploring other specifications like Cyclone, Dx and software, Id.

322
00:33:45.037 --> 00:33:55.800
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I i i don't know what shan thinking thinking, I'm thinking. But I don't care about the format of the Sbom.

323
00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:57.100
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): because

324
00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:01.000
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): now we I my my intention is

325
00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.240
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): that

326
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.799
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): what to ease that

327
00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.720
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Proc. Got used

328
00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.189
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): of the s. 1,

329
00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.860
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): so it is not limited as Pdx and the cycont.

330
00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:16.239
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and of course she savor, that is all. Studying.

331
00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:20.710
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): How to use is the main topic. I think I I

332
00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.129
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): yeah, I action.

333
00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:27.203
Arun Azhakesan: Yeah, I mean, I I would also share that.

334
00:34:27.819 --> 00:34:29.509
Arun Azhakesan: I think I think the more

335
00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:39.289
Arun Azhakesan: important part is on understanding the elements which which are directly responsible for security and compliance, and how we can fit into into the life cycle.

336
00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:41.959
Arun Azhakesan: Yeah. But as of, since we are

337
00:34:42.099 --> 00:34:48.409
Arun Azhakesan: kicking off a new study group. I just wanted to clarify the direction that we are heading.

338
00:34:48.519 --> 00:34:51.679
Arun Azhakesan: so that, you know we can set the right expectations.

339
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:54.449
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you.

340
00:34:56.020 --> 00:35:05.129
Anthony Harrison: Can I jump in as well? I think I've just said something on the comment which I think supports that I think we need to be looking at Content and the use cases of an S. Bob.

341
00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:10.260
Anthony Harrison: and then think about formats. Spd. X cycle, Mdx. With.

342
00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:21.500
Anthony Harrison: yes, it's disappointing. We have 2 2 major standards. But let's focus on the content, because that ultimately is what we want. The end users to be looking at.

343
00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:42.229
Anthony Harrison: And and ultimately, that's what the S bomb we need to be focusing on, how an S. An end user will use an Sbom. Internally, I think we all understand how an S bomb will benefit our Dev teams. But ultimately I think we need to look at what the use cases for an end user are what they value in terms of information that's valuable for them.

344
00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.370
Anthony Harrison: and then

345
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.249
Anthony Harrison: define what the format should be.

346
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:53.619
Anthony Harrison: So is that the direct direction of travel that you'd want the sub the study group to go to.

347
00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.439
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, thank you. Yes, I agree.

348
00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:02.050
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And Alex, just please.

349
00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:03.710
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): We got.

350
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:31.210
Alexios Zavras (Intel Corporation): Thank you. Yeah. I also want to say the same things that yeah, we shouldn't be focusing on the format. But we should be focusing, and not actually, as Anthony said, not only on the content, but also on the processes. Right? How do we use it, and how you know how these things are moved around and who looks at them, and how should they be produced and transferred and stuff like that?

351
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:37.760
Alexios Zavras (Intel Corporation): So yeah, the format, we can just ignore it for now, and talk about S. Bombs in general.

352
00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:43.880
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you very much. Yes, completely agree.

353
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:54.089
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And every time we asked from the my colleague in my company what content should be failed in the asphalt.

354
00:36:54.630 --> 00:37:03.880
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and there are many topics described in the format, but what should be included in the asphalt as rarely found.

355
00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:08.780
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So we I don't like to discuss about that in this one very group.

356
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:17.980
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): David had some great notes as well. David, would you like to talk to them or just want to leave it written.

357
00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:40.919
David Leichner: No, I'm happy. I'm happy to talk to them. I'm also happy to open my video if you want so yeah. So we've come across multiple customers who have various different scanning tools for Sbom's. And they're using also a combination of Spdx and cyclone Dx.

358
00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:50.387
David Leichner: And oh, they have open source. They have package custom packaged you know, products. Or I should say, components. They're getting components from their supply chain.

359
00:37:50.810 --> 00:38:08.390
David Leichner: And all of those have to be integrated together. But we we really can't forget the quality of the S bombs. And and this is something that's really important, because when you in fact, I had a conversation with Alan Friedman last week from Sisa, the Cyber Security infus critical infrastructure agency in the Us.

360
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:14.459
David Leichner: And he, he said, one of the biggest problems is not only interoperability, but the fact that

361
00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:32.230
David Leichner: you have all of these different tools you need to make sure that they're all producing similar quality spums which they aren't today, and that we know for a fact. So even when you know, you talk about the distribution of these spums. You have to 1st of all, worry about the quality we have to worry about how they interrupt, interoperate together.

362
00:38:32.803 --> 00:38:36.910
David Leichner: You know, within one environment, especially when you're talking about compliance.

363
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:55.260
David Leichner: And you know, if you were, if you're talking about Co supply chain. Well, then, it's a whole nother game, because, you know, you're getting you're getting components. If you if you're familiar with embedded world in in Nuremberg there are 5 holes of small and medium sized and large component providers who provide

364
00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:58.050
David Leichner: manufacturers with, you know.

365
00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:18.889
David Leichner: millions of different types of components, and each one of those now, according to Cra, and according to Wp. 29 R. 155. And if it's medical devices, the Fba, the FDA's pre market in the Us. They require Sbom's, and these people are cyber poor. They don't know the 1st thing about S. Bombs. And it's it's a big issue.

366
00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:37.980
David Leichner: So I think we need to look at, you know, even just getting back to basics, quality, interoperability. And then you know how you take it from there and managing all of the different S bombs, just just. I'll leave you with one last thing, which is, I spoke to. An automotive oem manufacturer.

367
00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:44.199
David Leichner: Every now that now that cars are being updated the software is being updated. Ota.

368
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:45.910
David Leichner: so over the air.

369
00:39:45.950 --> 00:40:14.013
David Leichner: each one of those updates is a new Sbom. So it's not just that you have a vehicle identification number. That is an Sbom. But every time there's an update that also is an Sbom. So you're talking about so many different variations. Just you know if we think about one vehicle over the course of 5 years, that vehicle could have 50 Sbombs depending on how often. You know, the updates are made. So we're we're talking about. You know, it's not just like

370
00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:23.519
David Leichner: you know, thinking about the distribution is thinking about how we gonna manage this, as as you know, especially the big manufacturer is on the call here. How are we gonna manage all of that.

371
00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:32.480
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Thank you, David. Great input there. And I noticed this touches on something that Anthony just brought up

372
00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.420
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): couple of minutes ago.

373
00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:42.059
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We also had a Lynn touch. I think it was a Lynn. Let me just oh, sorry, Leo, touch this topic.

374
00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.870
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Leah was talking about how to manage

375
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.960
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): unmatched components from upstream.

376
00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:55.060
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And Anthony was talking about quality of S bomb pointing out that

377
00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:59.009
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the way we use Sbom's

378
00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:01.060
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): to try to improve

379
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:04.789
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the software ecosystem software ecosystem

380
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:11.560
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): is important to try to ensure that metadata is correct. And again, we're looking at missing

381
00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:15.120
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): or incorrect mask metadata. So

382
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:18.379
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the very practical situation is

383
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.060
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): upstream

384
00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:32.079
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): current stream and downstream. How do we? How do we get accurate S bombs, regardless of what the S bomb is, regardless of what our purpose is, if it's a supply chain.

385
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:33.900
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): how do we get accurate

386
00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.680
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): now? Yan made a note

387
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:39.969
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): in the chat as well.

388
00:41:40.705 --> 00:41:44.560
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): You know, saying that quality will always be an issue.

389
00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:49.420
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And you know, perhaps focusing on interoperability might help

390
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:53.200
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): quality, criteria, interoperability.

391
00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.980
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and then verification

392
00:41:56.020 --> 00:42:03.220
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): could allow us to make sure, or at least to address some of the question of How does information move through the supply chain?

393
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:14.040
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): These are just comments from the chat that came up, and I thought were interesting. There was another comment that I thought was interesting is from Ellen.

394
00:42:14.468 --> 00:42:23.979
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And it's a it's a question. And this is something. Maybe Kobota sand can speak to the question, is, is there any plan to support Spd. X. Light

395
00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:32.899
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): for future Spd. X. Versions now combat? And if I recall correctly. Spd. X. Lite has been

396
00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:34.730
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): included

397
00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:41.080
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): in Spd. X. Since version 2.1 that became Iso.

398
00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:43.700
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): 5, 9, 6, 2.

399
00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:53.059
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So it's in the current Iso standard. But the question is, is there a plan to support Spd in future? Spdx versions.

400
00:42:55.701 --> 00:43:05.619
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): As I communicated with Fbds communities and the project community and talk with some specific person.

401
00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.774
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): how do they support it.

402
00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.530
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): ask to include that license specification?

403
00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:21.950
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It it's my understanding. Is it correct? I'd like to help with our exhaust.

404
00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.373
Alexios Zavras (Intel Corporation): Of course it's correct.

405
00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:27.290
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah, very much.

406
00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:46.169
Alexios Zavras (Intel Corporation): So the Spd x 3, that is currently ha! We have published 3 point O, and we're now finalizing 3 0 1, which will be sent to Iso to become a standard, and this includes Spd. X. Light specification definitely.

407
00:43:50.820 --> 00:44:00.150
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Well, that's great news for continuity. So, Alan, the answer is, yes. So if you're using Spd X light

408
00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:01.810
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): with Iso 5

409
00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:03.819
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): 9, 6, 2,

410
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:10.100
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Colon 2021. You can expect to use it in the next update of the Iso standard

411
00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:11.469
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): has wow!

412
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:19.220
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): A comment from Ninjoji San, one of our big community contributors and another open chain board member.

413
00:44:19.823 --> 00:44:24.520
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): But he likes the idea of having this study group as a place to discuss

414
00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:30.000
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): practices in companies and to build certain consensus around

415
00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:33.029
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): S bomb management, which seems to be

416
00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:35.900
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): most common topic we've had here today.

417
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:41.039
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): With that, it sounds like we're perfectly positioned

418
00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:43.270
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): for the next part of this call.

419
00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:47.190
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): which is to discuss next steps.

420
00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:53.109
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And we really have 3 questions. How often should we meet?

421
00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.059
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): How should we address topics.

422
00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:58.749
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and how long should the meetings be?

423
00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:04.340
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So I've got 3 initial suggestions, and they're just designed to

424
00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:08.860
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): provoke conversation. You might agree you might not.

425
00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:14.629
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): you might have another idea. All of that is valid. This kickoff call is designed for that.

426
00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.359
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): The initial suggestion

427
00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:20.029
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): to get the conversation started

428
00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.400
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): is that we meet once a month.

429
00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:24.790
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and we have

430
00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:26.509
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): one case study

431
00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:27.850
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): per meeting

432
00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:29.270
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): like today.

433
00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.369
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We had this overview of Spd X slide.

434
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:36.219
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and the meeting could be one or 2Â h long.

435
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.520
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Do you think

436
00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:44.400
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): that would be interesting for you, or would it be useful for you?

437
00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:46.950
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Would it help reach the goal

438
00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:51.190
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): of making sure practical how to information is available.

439
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:59.250
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): David, I noticed you unmuted yourself. If you want to jump in, you are most welcome.

440
00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:03.762
David Leichner: You know I was. I was just gonna say that.

441
00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.860
David Leichner: there, there are groups that meet on a weekly basis.

442
00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:18.941
David Leichner: and you know they? Their goal is, you know, th different work groups have different goals, and some of them are more policy oriented. Some of them are more information oriented.

443
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:28.330
David Leichner: and and I think that what once a month is is actually quite good for sharing information.

444
00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:32.109
David Leichner: and maybe maybe there should be a way of

445
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:44.070
David Leichner: during that month, having, you know, a mechanism. Maybe it's a slack channel. Maybe it's something else where people can share information also during the month, and not just have, you know, not just wait for the month.

446
00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.090
David Leichner: the month's meeting to come.

447
00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:48.110
David Leichner: If that makes sense.

448
00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:51.759
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): That makes a lot of sense, and the good news is

449
00:46:51.820 --> 00:47:02.680
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): that we have already set up a mailing list and a slack channel for this group. So I'll put that into the chat. I'll put the link to that into the chat

450
00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:08.589
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): so that people can access that information. Alexios, I noticed. Your hand is up.

451
00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:18.420
Alexios Zavras (Intel Corporation): It's down now. My question was also, yeah. Besides, the meetings will we also have a way to communicate asynchronously.

452
00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:22.299
Alexios Zavras (Intel Corporation): you know, outside the meetings, but it's already covered. Thank you.

453
00:47:23.271 --> 00:47:31.100
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): You're super welcome. We have a dedicated mailing list, which is the probably the most common way for us to

454
00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:42.169
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): facilitate discussion. We have a slack channel, and we've got a dedicated Github repo. So we can store the case studies and so on and so forth.

455
00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.900
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Great question came in from Anthony.

456
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:53.760
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): how different is this to other S. Paul. Meetings going on around the world like open Ssf. Csa. And so on.

457
00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:57.880
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So, Anthony, I'd say the primary difference with us

458
00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:00.809
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): is that the open chain project

459
00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:04.260
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): is very much a global

460
00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:06.430
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): cross industry

461
00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.260
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): process management project.

462
00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:19.320
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We're not focused on one geography, like, for example, a bias towards United States infrastructure management.

463
00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:24.029
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We're not biased towards one topic, like, for example.

464
00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:25.840
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): security.

465
00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:36.659
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): What we're instead focused on is the very large question of what are the commonalities in industrial software process management?

466
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:43.129
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So our goal would not be to replicate or repeat what others are doing.

467
00:48:43.945 --> 00:48:52.530
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): But to address the big picture of what are the common challenges and common solutions in essentially

468
00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:57.000
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the industrial global open source supply chain.

469
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:59.300
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Some of those solutions

470
00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:01.170
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): will be very much

471
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:09.409
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): about learning what has open Ssf done in this domain? What is Csa up to? I mean, Alan is obviously

472
00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:12.229
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): epically good on this topic.

473
00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:15.820
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): but we also want to ask questions like.

474
00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:25.699
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): what's happening over in European Telco as they determine S bomb quality for their industrial sector. Open chain actually just released a guide on that

475
00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:27.850
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): built by our Telco work group.

476
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:36.620
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): or what type of regulation around software bill of materials is emerging in China, in what domains and why.

477
00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.300
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): in very practical terms in Europe.

478
00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:56.140
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): How is the Cyber Resilience act adding or not adding to the industrial supply chain requirements? So our optic is very high, Anthony, and what we'd hope to do is to bring together bits of information from around the world.

479
00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:59.789
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): find those commonalities, and try to make sure that

480
00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.030
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): companies engaging with us

481
00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:03.729
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): in our space

482
00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:08.740
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): will be getting the type of useful practical information

483
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:16.090
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): that they need for all the different aspects of how to manage their S. Bombs and supply chain.

484
00:50:17.502 --> 00:50:19.350
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): That doesn't mean that

485
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.920
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): we're going to be more useful than anyone else.

486
00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:34.020
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and it doesn't mean that we're trying to dilute audiences. Essentially, where this came from was that we had a lot of Sbom stuff happening in open chain

487
00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:36.019
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): with this wide optic.

488
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:39.479
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and we wanted to bring it together in one space.

489
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:46.169
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So the Telco S bomb quality work, the Japanese work on things like Spdx lite

490
00:50:46.505 --> 00:50:52.110
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and and we wanted to bring it together in the context of open chain. But as this audience shows

491
00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:55.890
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): where we had around 40 people on this call.

492
00:50:56.110 --> 00:51:06.370
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the interest goes far beyond just the open chain community itself. That's great, and I do hope to be doing things like asking Alan to

493
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:09.270
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): dial in and tell us what's up at Cisa

494
00:51:09.643 --> 00:51:12.579
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and let us know what should be on our radar.

495
00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:14.779
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We do expect to have.

496
00:51:15.801 --> 00:51:22.490
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): People who are experts in things like the emerging cyber resilience act. Talk to that in more detail.

497
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:24.709
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): That being said.

498
00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:31.950
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): we we already have dug into some of these topics, and you can find, for example, a great series of webinars.

499
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:33.569
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): covering

500
00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:39.839
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the Cra and other European topics like the Product Liability Directive

501
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.220
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and the AI Act. I put a link into our webinar

502
00:51:44.965 --> 00:51:45.310
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): move

503
00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:52.530
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): series as a whole. There's 90 webinars there in total, and I just put a direct link into the cra

504
00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:57.230
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): right

505
00:51:59.310 --> 00:52:02.329
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): any further questions at this juncture.

506
00:52:02.873 --> 00:52:06.869
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): If not, then my next question is, what do you think?

507
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:08.610
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Monthly?

508
00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:11.290
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): One case. Study per workshop

509
00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:16.449
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): about 1Â h long, and the next one is in September.

510
00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:17.933
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Get that?

511
00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:22.030
Arun Azhakesan: Yeah, I yeah, I think monthly one would be better.

512
00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.040
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): All right

513
00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:29.330
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): now. The audience seems to be remarkably good.

514
00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:32.770
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Should we stick at this time for now?

515
00:52:33.775 --> 00:52:34.400
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So.

516
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:35.410
Arun Azhakesan: You.

517
00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:38.639
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Your morning, Asia afternoon. What do you think.

518
00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:43.630
Arun Azhakesan: I think this time is fine. I I should, I would say. Let's stick to this.

519
00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:51.020
Alexios Zavras (Intel Corporation): The time is great. If we can find any other day but Tuesday, it will even better for me.

520
00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:53.440
Alexios Zavras (Intel Corporation): because I cannot attend Tuesdays.

521
00:52:54.140 --> 00:53:02.819
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Okay, no, that's really good feedback. So not Tuesdays around this time starting September. How about

522
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.180
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Wednesdays?

523
00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:21.949
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): This is just a vague question to see if anyone has a regular block on Wednesdays, and I'm asking it because open chain tends to have meetings on Tuesdays or Thursdays. So Wednesdays tend to be a little bit open.

524
00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:29.439
Arun Azhakesan: I think Wednesdays we do have the open chain, the automation tooling group.

525
00:53:30.101 --> 00:53:44.390
Arun Azhakesan: I mean, I'm I'm not sure about the latest calendar, because my calendar doesn't reflect that. But I'm sure that Wednesday morning there is something, because at software 360 community, we had adjusted our time according to that. So maybe it would be wise to check

526
00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:46.150
Arun Azhakesan: that once, and then

527
00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:47.739
Arun Azhakesan: take the next step.

528
00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:52.619
Balakrishna Mukundaraj: Even I remember seeing a tooling group meeting one somewhere.

529
00:53:53.950 --> 00:54:03.589
Alexios Zavras (Intel Corporation): The tooling group is happening every 2 weeks, and we're talking about doing it monthly. So, and the tooling group

530
00:54:04.557 --> 00:54:08.979
Alexios Zavras (Intel Corporation): alternate between mornings and afternoons. So

531
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:13.199
Alexios Zavras (Intel Corporation): probably we will be okay. But we definitely have to check this. Yeah.

532
00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:19.743
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Okay. Marcel's hand is up. I'm guessing this is about the tooling group as well.

533
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:29.043
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): All right.

534
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:32.529
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I don't hear any audio on your end, Marcel.

535
00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:34.460
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Just so, you know.

536
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:44.071
Alexios Zavras (Intel Corporation): Oh, but Cobota San Run wrote on the chat that it doesn't work for him, so we can forget.

537
00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:48.799
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I'm sorry Wednesday doesn't work for me.

538
00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:52.900
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Oh, goodness! Our chair is the only one causing trouble.

539
00:54:54.873 --> 00:54:55.560
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But the

540
00:54:56.147 --> 00:55:00.179
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I tried to arrange my schedule once a month.

541
00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:04.689
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): No, no, no, I mean, the fact is, Wednesday was just an example.

542
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:11.200
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): well, let's let's put it on the mailing list. Let's do a simple test, and

543
00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:12.940
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I mean we we have.

544
00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:15.950
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We have plenty of days to choose from.

545
00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.270
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Soap.

546
00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:23.559
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Not Tuesday, we know, and Wednesday preferably not as well got it.

547
00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:27.360
Mary Wang: I think, from today's

548
00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:34.620
Mary Wang: participant the quantity quantity, I think today's the best time, at least for me as well.

549
00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:41.499
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yes, but we can't get Lexi's on Tuesdays, but it's a very good point, Mary.

550
00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:42.540
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Let's see.

551
00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:46.440
Mary Wang: Because today, right, we have 40 people.

552
00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:48.289
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Today, amazing and.

553
00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:49.109
Mary Wang: This time.

554
00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:51.990
Mary Wang: If we can keep this number it will be great.

555
00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:55.800
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Absolutely absolutely.

556
00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:04.839
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): It's, you know, the the timing. 9 9 am. In Europe, and then 4 pm. Here in Japan. It's 3 pm. In in China.

557
00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:10.749
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I'm not sure what time it is in India. I think it's 1230.

558
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:11.979
Arun Azhakesan: 1230, 1230.
