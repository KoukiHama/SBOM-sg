00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.710
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Hello, everyone, for some of you. It's been at least 10 seconds since we spoke.

2
00:01:21.317 --> 00:01:26.490
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I'm just going to share the slides and whatnot, so that we have

3
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.840
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): everything on the screen.

4
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.119
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Let me try that again.

5
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.119
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): There we go.

6
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:55.299
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We won't start for about 5 min, so we'll wait here and give everyone a chance to dial in and then we will begin the meeting in 5 min. We expect our chair, Kubota San, from Sony to take lead on the discussion.

7
00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.469
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and it'll be building. On the previous meeting we had for this work group.

8
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.300
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I'm pausing briefly here as I set myself as host.

9
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.750
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and our chair will get co-host

10
00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.270
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): when he arrives.

11
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:21.049
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): For those of you who might have missed the previous meeting. I'm just gonna put a link to that into the chat

12
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.929
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): to make sure that everyone has that recording.

13
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.060
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Shane.

14
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.970
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Gary, how's.

15
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:31.880
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Switzerland.

16
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.270
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Keeping it.

17
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:44.729
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): It's it's sunny at the moment. But the question is about Japan. I was trying to look the weather forecast because I need to start packing soon, so I guess it will be rainy and quite warm there next week.

18
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.339
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yes, unfortunately, it's a bit rainy at the moment.

19
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.950
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I've got to check, actually.

20
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.169
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): because I'm I'm very southwest.

21
00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:11.639
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yeah, yeah. So I can't say exactly what it's like in Tokyo, right? Tokyo is 24 degrees centigrade. Unfortunately, intermittent showers. The chance of rain today was 71%. But later in the week it goes to 0,

22
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.650
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): then 100, then 0, and so on. You can expect it to go somewhere between 20 to 24

23
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.410
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and rainy-ish.

24
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.780
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Yeah.

25
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.319
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): yeah, that's what I was expecting, you know, at this time of the year, you know you are, anyway, on the island. So

26
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.919
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): one needs to be prepared for everything more or less.

27
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.780
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Alan just noted. Thank you for checking the weather. It's my pleasure. Secondary service of the open chain project.

28
00:03:44.535 --> 00:03:45.100
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yep.

29
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.500
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Okay, all right.

30
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.119
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Talk to you in a sec. Mob.

31
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.810
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I was just thinking, you know, and now I'm from the British Isles. I'm Irish.

32
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.620
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): but British Isles. We always talk about the weather, anyway.

33
00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:03.120
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and it's interesting that the weather in Tokyo tends not to be very similar to the weather where I am.

34
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.849
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): It varies a lot.

35
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.499
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I see Kubota San has arrived. I'll make him co-host

36
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.480
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and hallelujah!

37
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.180
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I'm going to make Ninjaji-san and Owada San co-hosts as well

38
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.250
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): in case they need to do something in the background.

39
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.430
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I don't see any dispatch.

Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): With another 2 min before we start.

43
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.119

78
00:07:43.750 --> 00:08:06.470
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): there was a note that came in that cyclone. Dx community is doing something around tracking patent information. Do any of us have a contact for that?

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:35.829
Takashi Ninjouji: I'm not talking about Spdx slides more general matters.

115
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:41.270
Takashi Ninjouji: So from here I'm sorry I cut off my camera.

119
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:23.589
Takashi Ninjouji: and from there considerations for s. 1 quality that the open chain project hopes to promote in the future.

120
00:12:23.965 --> 00:12:28.799
Takashi Ninjouji: Such as the those in the light of the take awesome guide, I hope.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:36.980
Takashi Ninjouji: oh.

124
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:43.429
Takashi Ninjouji: okay. And then this slide shows some laws, regulations and standards and guidelines rated s. 1

125
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:57.540
Takashi Ninjouji: in 2021 executive in United States Executive Order for 1, 40, 28 was issued in the United States, and there has been a lot of activity in the areas of cyber security.

126
00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:03.690
Takashi Ninjouji: In response to this the Natia has issued minimum elements

127
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.869
Takashi Ninjouji: for software video materials

128
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:13.349
Takashi Ninjouji: in the United States. The FDA has issued guidelines for medical devices. We would talk about sorry.

129
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.100
Takashi Ninjouji: and the

130
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.750
Takashi Ninjouji: we will talk about Csis documents later.

131
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.049
Takashi Ninjouji: This is a similar movement in Europe.

132
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:22.230
Takashi Ninjouji: and the

133
00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:29.480
Takashi Ninjouji: Cra. Is currently holding off on publishing in the offshore gadget.

134
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:36.120
Takashi Ninjouji: We are aware that the European Commission has not yet issued any specific documents related to s. 1, however.

135
00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:39.980
Takashi Ninjouji: the Vsi German agency in

138
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:57.629
Takashi Ninjouji: The latest version is 2.0 point 0 as a previous mission. Since the lease of the 4th version last year it has already been devised twice

139
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:07.419
Takashi Ninjouji: in Japan, Methi, the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and industry, has published the second version of the Sbm guidelines for Japanese enterprises.

140
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.339
Takashi Ninjouji: Hi. But this is probably only a small part of what has already been published.

141
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:18.959
Takashi Ninjouji: In addition to these, there are also swam guidelines published in

142
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.330
Takashi Ninjouji: countries such as New Zealand, India, and China.

143
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:29.569
Takashi Ninjouji: and the Yes Open chain specification for process management, 50 to 30

144
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.279
Takashi Ninjouji: for license compliance, and the 1 89, 74

145
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:37.049
Takashi Ninjouji: for security actions. These specification

146
00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:40.290
Takashi Ninjouji: bigquery has expo management needs process management.

147
00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:48.969
Takashi Ninjouji: and as many of you may already know. 2 data formats based on open source are international standards. Spdx.

148
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:55.879
Takashi Ninjouji: which is Iso, IC. 59, 62, and second Dx, which is Ecma 4, 2, 4,

149
00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:03.490
Takashi Ninjouji: and the industry driven activities and initiatives, for example, medical devices, manufacturers

150
00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:09.200
Takashi Ninjouji: and the payment card industry, data, security standard and automotive and Telco.

151
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.600
Takashi Ninjouji: Now open Trintecosm Guide

152
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.430
Takashi Ninjouji: is the intimate.

153
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:40.280
Takashi Ninjouji: It's element based on 50 to 60 Iso, IC. 59, 62, and later burdened as Spt. 2.3. This work is by tech working group of the option project with an insight table of telecom industry companies like Rixon and then cure and other European companies. Also, it's intended for telecom industries, but it seems to be available for other industries.

154
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:54.270
Takashi Ninjouji: And in particular, if you look at the statement that referred to the requirements for Sm contents. You can see that almost all refer to the Notm. Emma elements.

155
00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:02.630
Takashi Ninjouji: A country, she says, is developing activities related to S. Form in the United States. She's also released a frame software

156
00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:06.560
Takashi Ninjouji: company Transparency Foundation this month.

157
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:13.029
Takashi Ninjouji: Let's take a brief look at the Utm minimum elements and the S. Mode attributes in Css. Token.

158
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:22.829
Takashi Ninjouji: She's a streaming 3rd agent is providing updates from practical perspectives, especially license compliance.

159
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:37.209
Takashi Ninjouji: Scher framing will not replace any theory. Minimum elements. It stated that Shisa has the authority to devise any theory minimum elements, but it seems that the framing is not yet to replace any. The minimum

160
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.340
Takashi Ninjouji: in the India minimum elements.

161
00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:41.480
Takashi Ninjouji: hashes

162
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:47.659
Takashi Ninjouji: and the license information and the copyright information are recommended. But in the Csis framing

163
00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.240
Takashi Ninjouji: they are now acquired

164
00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.200
Takashi Ninjouji: and regarding dependency relationships.

165
00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:01.519
Takashi Ninjouji: clarification has been made between the primary components and the

166
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:07.700
Takashi Ninjouji: component relationships. This it means it's dependent components.

167
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:14.500
Takashi Ninjouji: Some people think that the minimum elements will be devised around 2025. But from the impression I've got.

168
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:21.509
Takashi Ninjouji: it seems that the Caesar framing will be something familiar from the prospect of license components, practice in enterprise.

169
00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:28.510
Takashi Ninjouji: Sorry. Now, let's 1st take a look at the how well

170
00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:29.820
Takashi Ninjouji: us

171
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.785
Takashi Ninjouji: sorry.

172
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.299
Takashi Ninjouji: Look at the guidelines

173
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.020
Takashi Ninjouji: and the new.

174
00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:52.570
Takashi Ninjouji: the clients, and these new documents, some industry, specific requirements based on the presence of absence of, were attributed into s. 1. i apologize for the small text.

175
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:57.430
Takashi Ninjouji: however, the impression that it covers any tier minimum

176
00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.574
Takashi Ninjouji: requirements without any problems. Let's pick out attributes that

177
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.730
Takashi Ninjouji: highly common with Ntm. Csa-based attributes. And the BSI.

178
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.159
Takashi Ninjouji: I think it's a little bit easier to see. Now

179
00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.009
Takashi Ninjouji: let's look at them from the top down.

180
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.830
Takashi Ninjouji: The 1st difference is S bomb type.

181
00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.609
Takashi Ninjouji: The whales

182
00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.720
Takashi Ninjouji: we see it.

183
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:30.550
Takashi Ninjouji: We will see later. Csa doesn't necessarily require this, but the psi.

184
00:18:31.123 --> 00:18:33.039
Takashi Ninjouji: Sorry. This means optional aspiration.

185
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:35.429
Takashi Ninjouji: but Bsn ensures is from type.

186
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.690
Takashi Ninjouji: Sorry

187
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:41.640
Takashi Ninjouji: BSI doesn't seem the s 1 type, but there is no requirement for

188
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:47.389
Takashi Ninjouji: it's manage management information. However, the Technical Support Guide address is

189
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.970
Takashi Ninjouji: this one create a comment to

190
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.880
Takashi Ninjouji: comprise this ism type.

191
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:57.449
Takashi Ninjouji: Now it can be said that

192
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.390
Takashi Ninjouji: I am Dr. F.

193
00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:07.039
Takashi Ninjouji: And FDA are characterized by acquiring the support level of information. These ones

194
00:19:08.383 --> 00:19:09.429
Takashi Ninjouji: this one

195
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:10.950
Takashi Ninjouji: and this one.

196
00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:16.170
Takashi Ninjouji: This is something that sees this may be required, depending on the use cases.

197
00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.040
Takashi Ninjouji: And, on the other hand, as well.

198
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:22.860
Takashi Ninjouji: I mentioned later, also, BSI mentions

199
00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:31.450
Takashi Ninjouji: end of life and other useful information. But I couldn't find any mention of requiring this information to be included in this one.

200
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:38.389
Takashi Ninjouji: Currently Telco Sm guide doesn't clearly define the items that correspond in these sports

201
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:39.930
Takashi Ninjouji: items.

202
00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:46.339
Takashi Ninjouji: But, by the way, my guess is that the Pci, Dss. And Ss 5th

203
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.660
Takashi Ninjouji: is

204
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:55.870
Takashi Ninjouji: probably focused on the content separation of the services. For that reason it seems to be limited to the items that

205
00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.330
Takashi Ninjouji: or target vulnerability management

206
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.290
Takashi Ninjouji: in the subseparation

207
00:20:01.042 --> 00:20:15.359
Takashi Ninjouji: or BSI. It will almost certainly meet the requirement of medical devices, such as Imdrf and the FDA, as well as Pci. Dss.

208
00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:29.129
Takashi Ninjouji: On the items mentioned by Cesa. The 3 below are not constitutively mandatory.

209
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:30.670
Takashi Ninjouji: but the

210
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:43.639
Takashi Ninjouji: however, if the circle is some guidance to be used in the wider range of industries, better example of how they might be expressing Spdx 2.2 point 1 or Spdx 2.0. This might just

211
00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:44.940
Takashi Ninjouji: personal opinion

212
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.390
Takashi Ninjouji: for pedigree.

213
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:54.539
Takashi Ninjouji: you may need to consider adding the type of relationships you you were for

214
00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:55.690
Takashi Ninjouji: using.

215
00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.800
Takashi Ninjouji: for example, relationships generated from or

216
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.270
Takashi Ninjouji: descend down to OP.

217
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:08.319
Takashi Ninjouji: And the next system, the FDA's software level support

218
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.299
Takashi Ninjouji: can be only used in some kind of commit field

219
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:23.529
Takashi Ninjouji: someone wants to light them in the document, name or create a comment or document comment, or in some cases, so we should.

220
00:21:24.937 --> 00:21:27.450
Takashi Ninjouji: Clearly defined one

221
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.149
Takashi Ninjouji: comment, field is better.

222
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.100
Takashi Ninjouji: But the

223
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.020
Takashi Ninjouji: finally.

224
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.319
Takashi Ninjouji: this one

225
00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.590
Takashi Ninjouji: a 2,

226
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.819
Takashi Ninjouji: the FDA end of support date

227
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:51.200
Takashi Ninjouji: and the Medrf life cycle of a device or end of a support date. The same comment field is before can be used for Iso, 5,962.

228
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:58.839
Takashi Ninjouji: And if we can use the Spd point 3 valid until date is also, we can use it.

229
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:10.259
Takashi Ninjouji: I think that this matters will be the subject to discussion in the future tech working group or and the smosatic group. But I hope that a wave is some of your interests.

230
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.420
Takashi Ninjouji: In the next speech

231
00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.990
Takashi Ninjouji: there are attributes that only mentioned it by BSI.

232
00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:20.649
Takashi Ninjouji: This bomb you are right.

233
00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:22.520
Takashi Ninjouji: Component file name

234
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.840
Takashi Ninjouji: in the executable or not archival or not structured or not.

235
00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:33.000
Takashi Ninjouji: and the Uriable source code and deployable component. And the finally the associated licenses.

236
00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:45.669
Takashi Ninjouji: Okay, so this is also a consideration with this in the same way as before for both. Iso 5,962, and Spdex 2.3

237
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.910
Takashi Ninjouji: a file name.

238
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:48.290
Takashi Ninjouji: it's

239
00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:53.360
Takashi Ninjouji: can be expressed using a package file name.

240
00:22:53.830 --> 00:23:03.450
Takashi Ninjouji: Just to be sure, there is a statement in the second and final sentence of the section 3.3 dot 2 dot. One component

241
00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:08.010
Takashi Ninjouji: said that, depending on the circumstances of the build.

242
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.630
Takashi Ninjouji: it's acceptable to omit the cryptographic hash your file name.

243
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:19.640
Takashi Ninjouji: However, I'm worried that it doesn't seem to be a description just that either one is always sufficient.

244
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:22.249
Takashi Ninjouji: Okay, and skip to the next one.

245
00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:28.299
Takashi Ninjouji: and the Associated license can be handled with a package license from fires.

246
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:33.700
Takashi Ninjouji: However, this is something that lists all detected license.

247
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.570
Takashi Ninjouji: It's not liquid in the telecom guide.

248
00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:37.909
Takashi Ninjouji: As far as I know.

249
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.649
Takashi Ninjouji: it's not a topic now, but the

250
00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.909
Takashi Ninjouji: often discussed with. But it's not a

251
00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:48.349
Takashi Ninjouji: topic often discussed with people from other companies. As far as I know.

252
00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.200
Takashi Ninjouji: Now, let's go back about.

253
00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:58.629
Takashi Ninjouji: Now this requires information which component is executable, or archive, or structured or not.

254
00:23:59.713 --> 00:24:03.820
Takashi Ninjouji: It seems that the package commit will work for this. But

255
00:24:04.532 --> 00:24:13.029
Takashi Ninjouji: by the way, Sptx. 2.3, introduces the primary package purpose. This works, introduced by Cyclone Dx.

256
00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:23.170
Takashi Ninjouji: First.st But however, this property describes the type of the purpose, such as lovely or archive, and so on. Therefore it doesn't seem to express

257
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.960
Takashi Ninjouji: the status

258
00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.229
Takashi Ninjouji: which BSI requires.

259
00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:28.850
Takashi Ninjouji: So

260
00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.500
Takashi Ninjouji: we will stop you with the

261
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:36.119
Takashi Ninjouji: presence over absence of attributes and the corresponding spill

262
00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.430
Takashi Ninjouji: expressions.

263
00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:46.810
Takashi Ninjouji: Okay, from here on we will look at the comparison of the requirement of Csis document and the Bsr's document.

264
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:51.570
Takashi Ninjouji: But before we do that, let's take a quick look at Jesus. Maturity levels.

265
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:53.040
Takashi Ninjouji: As a menu.

266
00:24:53.480 --> 00:25:00.350
Takashi Ninjouji: As you may have noticed, it's a mixture of depths and breadths of dependencies and attributes levels.

267
00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:08.050
Takashi Ninjouji: The 1st level minimum expected covers a primary component and its included components.

268
00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.950
Takashi Ninjouji: The next level recommended practice.

269
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.860
Takashi Ninjouji: It covers the actual

270
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:19.609
Takashi Ninjouji: addition of attributes, data and supplements. Component identification as a wireless practice for creating S form.

271
00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:27.499
Takashi Ninjouji: And the last one is last level is aspirational, constant dynamic, and or remote dependencies.

272
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:29.860
Takashi Ninjouji: This color

273
00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:35.030
Takashi Ninjouji: chip indicates whether there are any requirements for each level.

274
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:37.329
Takashi Ninjouji: And now I brought

275
00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:41.739
Takashi Ninjouji: the cara chips for the requirements in the Gsas document

276
00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.090
Takashi Ninjouji: the s. 1 type.

277
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:49.250
Takashi Ninjouji: as a weekend we have already seen before earlier

278
00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:53.449
Takashi Ninjouji: that was mentioned earlier, is only mentioned in aspiration.

279
00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.509
Takashi Ninjouji: and there is a different relationships

280
00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.729
Takashi Ninjouji: and the license and the copyright notice

281
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.080
Takashi Ninjouji: in the unknown components.

282
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:12.899
Takashi Ninjouji: and so on. We will leave the unrelated issues for another time. So we will skip them this time. So let's take a look other than the BSI requirements.

283
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.930
Takashi Ninjouji: As we've seen, sister shows 3 maturity levels.

284
00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:23.019
Takashi Ninjouji: On the other hand, Bsa shows 5 categories as a level with details.

285
00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.100
Takashi Ninjouji: We will look at them in this order.

286
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:35.649
Takashi Ninjouji: Let's get started. Just this expression is not either document, but

287
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:44.939
Takashi Ninjouji: this ambitious research. But let's call the depth and breadth of the categories of the dependents and target components. Relationship resolution.

288
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:49.230
Takashi Ninjouji: For now. And this differs between the 2 documents.

289
00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:56.240
Takashi Ninjouji: She's a required. She's a document requires information on the remote component at aspiration, or, as we.

290
00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.040
Takashi Ninjouji: as we see earlier.

291
00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.309
Takashi Ninjouji: On the other hand, the BSI doesn't mention the modes.

292
00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:06.439
Takashi Ninjouji: but it does require information on the 1st component

293
00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:09.339
Takashi Ninjouji: that is outside the scope of delivery.

294
00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.929
Takashi Ninjouji: This is not a requirement. Insist. We will look at this later.

295
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:19.250
Takashi Ninjouji: and it's some type at least, be this one

296
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:26.480
Takashi Ninjouji: sure, as I mentioned earlier, she said, only makes it optional for aspiration goals.

297
00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:35.999
Takashi Ninjouji: and, on the other hand, the Bsa. Doesn't this s 1 type as a requirement, however, Bsa seems to be based on build s. 1.

298
00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:43.119
Takashi Ninjouji: this seems to be understandable. Given that the tr. 0 31, it's

299
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:44.810
Takashi Ninjouji: it's certain

300
00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:47.589
Takashi Ninjouji: 0 31, 8, 32

301
00:27:48.253 --> 00:28:05.819
Takashi Ninjouji: part 2 is a guide for Sm for preparing for Cra, and the kind of additional devices are the main target. So when comparing and considering a Css. Document and Bss documents, it may be good idea to assume the build. Spom. This is my personal opinion.

302
00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:15.480
Takashi Ninjouji: I think we've got the idea of the direction.

303
00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:21.049
Takashi Ninjouji: But let's take a closer look at maturity levels on the level of details. Briefly.

304
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.589
Takashi Ninjouji: this is the lowest level

305
00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:29.910
Takashi Ninjouji: system in my expected covers, primary component and dialect dependencies.

306
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:41.209
Takashi Ninjouji: On the other hand, BSI top level S bomb covers a primary component and all components which primary component directly depends on. So it seems to be a very similar definition.

307
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:43.479
Takashi Ninjouji: The that's it

308
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.310
Takashi Ninjouji: for the

309
00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:51.850
Takashi Ninjouji: later discussion. So I'm shortly, briefly introduce the this

310
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.129
Takashi Ninjouji: marks. What does it means?

311
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:58.670
Takashi Ninjouji: The 5th circle are

312
00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:00.150
Takashi Ninjouji: internal

313
00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:09.650
Takashi Ninjouji: components, and the fields square are external components and eternal component is one food created. It's different from that, the primary component

314
00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.950
Takashi Ninjouji: and the

315
00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:12.980
Takashi Ninjouji: if we

316
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:18.870
Takashi Ninjouji: yes, and the example for the external components. 3rd party components.

317
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.159
Takashi Ninjouji: it's

318
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.230
Takashi Ninjouji: it.

319
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:32.429
Takashi Ninjouji: and the rectangle, just the frame frame to the cotangle is just indicates. The component is outside the scope of the delivery.

320
00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:37.700
Takashi Ninjouji: and this gray crowd indicates the range of included into sable.

321
00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:49.060
Takashi Ninjouji: and the next level is, she says, recommended practices. This is supposed to include all components

322
00:29:50.039 --> 00:29:56.189
Takashi Ninjouji: included in the distribution. It is just a distribution, and it's just a distribution.

323
00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:00.549
Takashi Ninjouji: And the BSI defines a level such as an N level

324
00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:08.159
Takashi Ninjouji: and a transitive and a transitive delivery item en level is a step of depth from the primary component.

325
00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:14.360
Takashi Ninjouji: So, therefore, the top level s. 1 we saw earlier is one level of s 1

326
00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:16.990
Takashi Ninjouji: in this copy.

327
00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:23.630
Takashi Ninjouji: and the scope gradually expands transitively means the 4th external component is listed.

328
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:25.380
Takashi Ninjouji: and

329
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:31.220
Takashi Ninjouji: as we saw earlier, the delivery item is bombed. The 1st component outside the

330
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:32.350
Takashi Ninjouji: dirty buddy.

331
00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:37.850
Takashi Ninjouji: There a final level.

332
00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.829
Takashi Ninjouji: The Csa's aspiration goal is

333
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.690
Takashi Ninjouji: to include as many dynamic

334
00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:47.330
Takashi Ninjouji: and the remote components as possible in system.

335
00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:55.099
Takashi Ninjouji: On the other hand, Bsr's complete as well means to include all components that can be traced from the primary component.

336
00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.579
Takashi Ninjouji: This increase components

337
00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:04.080
Takashi Ninjouji: outside the scope. Sorry scope of the delivery as well as a full, open.

338
00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.850
Takashi Ninjouji: direct, or transcript dependent issues.

339
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:17.790
Takashi Ninjouji: Now, I'd like to introduce something that caught my attention again. Relationship, resolution.

340
00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:25.550
Takashi Ninjouji: She says the patient was remote and no levels mentioned outside scope of delivery. On the other hand.

341
00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:32.859
Takashi Ninjouji: BSI, in the BSI documents no mention about remote but needs the 1st component that is outside the scope of delivery.

342
00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:42.129
Takashi Ninjouji: My impression is it's necessary to give sufficient consideration to whether the Csis maturity, database, and the Vsi's level of detail quantify

343
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.140
Takashi Ninjouji: our transaction requirements and regulated requirements as well.

344
00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:56.620
Takashi Ninjouji: And the second topic is the license. It seems that the scope of the components covered the license information with expanding according to

345
00:31:56.870 --> 00:32:02.099
Takashi Ninjouji: maturity level. But there is one thing in the description about aspiration goal.

346
00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:06.599
Takashi Ninjouji: Now, this is the 1st time to get referred to, concluded license.

347
00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:16.220
Takashi Ninjouji: Does this mean that it's okay. If minimum, unexpected or recommended practice should at least covers the credit license. I'm not sure.

348
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:20.499
Takashi Ninjouji: But, on the other hand, BSI. Requires associated license

349
00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:27.700
Takashi Ninjouji: required associated license and additional concluded license and optional decreed license.

350
00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:36.070
Takashi Ninjouji: The order but priority of for declared and conclude the license does match between both

351
00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:36.850
Takashi Ninjouji: documents.

352
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:39.040
Takashi Ninjouji: but the.

353
00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:44.680
Takashi Ninjouji: as we can see in the telecom guide, both types concluded and declared

354
00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:52.420
Takashi Ninjouji: information are required for license compliances. So this difference is unlikely to cause any problems. But however.

355
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:56.070
Takashi Ninjouji: the fact that BSI requires associated rises

356
00:32:56.220 --> 00:33:00.339
Takashi Ninjouji: is an incremental change. I'm curious to know

357
00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:06.290
Takashi Ninjouji: how many companies are careful to include this kind of license mission in their

358
00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:12.560
Takashi Ninjouji: okay. The next one is the

359
00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:17.049
Takashi Ninjouji: hashtag. There seem to be a difference even with the hashtag rules.

360
00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:24.870
Takashi Ninjouji: She's the specified sha 2, 256, or higher.

361
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:26.620
Takashi Ninjouji: by the way.

362
00:33:27.853 --> 00:33:29.999
Takashi Ninjouji: Sorry. But.

363
00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.590
Takashi Ninjouji: on the other hand, the biggest size fish bytes.

364
00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:34.250
Takashi Ninjouji: 5

365
00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:35.590
Takashi Ninjouji: 100

366
00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:36.730
Takashi Ninjouji: 12.

367
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.509
Takashi Ninjouji: So it's a difference.

368
00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:47.520
Takashi Ninjouji: and that this is.

369
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:59.270
Takashi Ninjouji: could we need to use s. 1 and Csfpx for cyber security here? There is a debate about whether s. 1 and Csfpx should be used same data, file or separate files.

370
00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:08.659
Takashi Ninjouji: Psychon Dx has introduced vulnerabilities model which can express begs also Spdx, 3.0 can also express bags with security profile.

371
00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:29.289
Takashi Ninjouji: From this it's technically possible to express Sbom and Bex in the same. Json versus Json led file in each data format. However, the question is whether or not it's necessary to combine the contents which are distributed with additional signature and have different updated freak sheets into one data file.

372
00:34:29.949 --> 00:34:35.160
Takashi Ninjouji: There appears to be a difference in nuance between Shisa and the BSI document

373
00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:39.060
Takashi Ninjouji: that there is a description like this.

374
00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:40.510
Takashi Ninjouji: Sheesa

375
00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:47.600
Takashi Ninjouji: insist document says, nor expected to be included in the Spom itself.

376
00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:48.949
Takashi Ninjouji: Why

377
00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.570
Takashi Ninjouji: BSI sits

378
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:52.199
Takashi Ninjouji: not contain.

379
00:34:52.810 --> 00:35:04.219
Takashi Ninjouji: Furthermore, it stated that it is required not to include vulnerability information in an Sbom, even though an Sbom format specification supports that

380
00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:11.470
Takashi Ninjouji: from this point of view it seems that the direction is to operate them separately

381
00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.619
Takashi Ninjouji: by the way as a side note

382
00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:20.419
Takashi Ninjouji: at the same time as Bsat 0 3, 1, 82, part 2,

383
00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:25.310
Takashi Ninjouji: part 3, version 0 point 0 dot 9 dot 0

384
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:26.220
Takashi Ninjouji: buzz

385
00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:30.149
Takashi Ninjouji: also released as a guide for vulnerability management.

386
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:37.860
Takashi Ninjouji: This document mentioned the Csf. As a data format, and Cis has already published minimum requirements for becs.

387
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:46.829
Takashi Ninjouji: Natural openbex is being implemented in open Ssf. Compared to Shesf, it seems openbex is a lighter structure and description.

388
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:53.919
Takashi Ninjouji: so it will be interesting to see how it open backs with the proper and the modules, and how to

389
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:55.640
Takashi Ninjouji: use

390
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:59.910
Takashi Ninjouji: the OP. Shisa for open decks or boards.

391
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:02.920
Takashi Ninjouji: Just my curiosity.

392
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:09.480
Takashi Ninjouji: and this is the last thing we are going to introduce today.

393
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.110
Takashi Ninjouji: Endobix.

394
00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:16.579
Takashi Ninjouji: in Shesa's document. It's supplemental information to support use cases.

395
00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:33.860
Takashi Ninjouji: The example seems to be required by Mdrf. Under FDA that we've already seen earlier. On the other hand, in BSI document, it says, the version number version number of should reflect the minimum required version. Sorry I'm not highlighted.

396
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:40.040
Takashi Ninjouji: but it makes easy to know the skip button that end of life for security vulnerabilities.

397
00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:48.450
Takashi Ninjouji: So, however, there is no requirement to clarify clearly to indicate information such as end of life, date or so.

398
00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.909
Takashi Ninjouji: We have groups.

399
00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:02.250
Takashi Ninjouji: a lot of things. But I've only got one more thing to say

400
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:13.320
Takashi Ninjouji: when it comes to risk management in the software supply chain, it seems important to carefully consider stakeholders what kind of information is handled and how it's shared.

401
00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:18.059
Takashi Ninjouji: It seems that we need to be aware of the flow of

402
00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:20.959
Takashi Ninjouji: information in B, 2 B.

403
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.490
Takashi Ninjouji: Sorry I'm not

404
00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:29.140
Takashi Ninjouji: illustrated, but the b 2 c, and also and the regulatory authorities.

405
00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:47.000
Takashi Ninjouji: This is the final side. I hope we can have various discussion with everyone in the community. She says, maturity level, a much mixture of depth and the broads broadness of dependency and the information richness. So

406
00:37:47.446 --> 00:37:50.820
Takashi Ninjouji: smo quality is likely to be almost like, is it okay?

407
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:57.440
Takashi Ninjouji: And in the sense of the difference between, she says, document and Vsi's document.

408
00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:02.409
Takashi Ninjouji: how how to handle maturity level versus develop details.

409
00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:05.050
Takashi Ninjouji: and what river with attribute

410
00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:09.650
Takashi Ninjouji: is adequate for every stakeholders in the software chain

411
00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:12.960
Takashi Ninjouji: and how to how to express.

412
00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:18.179
Takashi Ninjouji: the smog document, both Sbdx and second Dx.

413
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:30.010
Takashi Ninjouji: Also, also, it's not mentioned here that I'm also interested in automating the management of S. Bombs and vulnerability across the software development lifecycle.

414
00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.950
Takashi Ninjouji: Thank you so much for your listening.

415
00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:35.990
Takashi Ninjouji: My

416
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.890
Takashi Ninjouji: presentation is finished.

417
00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.140
Takashi Ninjouji: Thank you.

418
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:42.429
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you. And easier, Sam.

419
00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:51.510
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And as our last slide, I needed some mention. Are there any comments or discussion questions.

420
00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.260
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I see quite a lot of.

421
00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:02.360
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and comments in the chat.

422
00:39:03.201 --> 00:39:06.429
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): It's been very exciting over there. So

423
00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.520
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): of.

424
00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:18.154
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): There's so many comments here that I think it might be useful if it's okay to ask people to speak to their ideas and notes.

425
00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:27.140
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Anthony, I noticed you had quite a lot to say. I was wondering if you'd like to summarize some of the key points that

426
00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:33.229
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): you know you found interesting. You think that should be looked at next.

427
00:39:33.649 --> 00:39:39.520
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): I think it's very useful to see the comparison of all these different guidelines.

428
00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:51.410
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): I wish there was a single one personally, because it's going to make, you know, software, global. And I would really like everyone to harmonize on one set.

429
00:39:51.801 --> 00:40:15.660
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): It might be a low, low level initially. But we are. We're still in the crawling stage of S bombs, and I would like us to get the quality of S bombs. Simple S bombs sorted out 1st before we get too detailed and making them better. Having said that, I think the use of the different types of S bombs, I think, is really important.

430
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:32.220
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): You can't just say an S bomb when there's 6 different types of S bombs, I think is really important. You think about your who's going to use us bomb? Because each as you go through the lifecycle, you get more and more information. So

431
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:56.720
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): if I'm in a production environment, I want to know the versions of the components that are running in production, and that's not going to be available at a source S bomb, because I don't know the dynamic linkage of the components. So I think you really need to be very careful when you ask for an S bomb, you need to be more precise. So it's great the discussion about S bomb type. And I think that's an evolving

432
00:40:57.095 --> 00:41:07.119
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): discussion within the community. So I see a lot just as source S bombs. That doesn't give me enough information when I want to do vulnerability risk management.

433
00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:18.219
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): So I think that's a really important point that I do, I think, was well articulated in the discussion, and personally, I think we have a lot to lot to get to, because

434
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:20.460
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): the tooling isn't quite there yet.

435
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:40.739
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): And the second point is, I think we also need to think about the vulnerabilities and S. Bombs. S. Bombs have static vulnerabilities are very dynamic. I wouldn't want to be updating my Sbom. Every time a new vulnerability comes up or a new assessment comes up. So I'm I'm very, very

436
00:41:40.880 --> 00:42:00.230
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): an advocate of keeping Sbom static and having a more dynamic vex format. I know this is. There's a different opinions, I know. Thomas came up with a comment, challenging me, but from a personal perspective, I think it's going to be far easier to say I have product. And this is the version of the Sbom.

437
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:12.200
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): the separatist separate life cycle for vulnerabilities. So I think they need to be kept separate. So I agree with what was being recommended by the BSI in that. And I would. You know I would support that.

438
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:13.949
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): So there's a lot there.

439
00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:25.320
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you very much, and I'd like to hear the thought from the Thomas.

440
00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:35.080
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): He is who is one contributor to the Spds. $3 or security profile. Thomas, do you have any thoughts on this.

441
00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:44.910
Thomas Steenbergen: Yeah, thank you. Hassan. Yeah, there was a whole discussion since I worked on the 2 pro security profile.

442
00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.859
Thomas Steenbergen: whether to include vex or not. And

443
00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:51.789
Thomas Steenbergen: I think the fundamental question is.

444
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:53.750
Thomas Steenbergen: is, actually.

445
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:55.850
Thomas Steenbergen: there's 2 streams of thoughts.

446
00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:59.819
Thomas Steenbergen: So one is there. An S bomb is a static document

447
00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:07.070
Thomas Steenbergen: that you ship over like it's a physical. Think of it as a word document or a quality insurance document that you ship with a product.

448
00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:16.189
Thomas Steenbergen: And the other one train of thought is that the S bomb is more an Api stream.

449
00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:21.350
Thomas Steenbergen: So basically, the suppliers and the consumers are part of a

450
00:43:21.785 --> 00:43:30.054
Thomas Steenbergen: network communication. And then the question comes, the S bomb is not necessarily the document, but the S bomb is kind of

451
00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:35.559
Thomas Steenbergen: in that, you see, in 3.0 is kind of a container where you can link multiple informations together.

452
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:44.099
Thomas Steenbergen: And and so these are the 2 faults. Why, in Spx 3.0, you see that basically.

453
00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:46.669
Thomas Steenbergen: the both scenarios are supported.

454
00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:51.459
Thomas Steenbergen: So one is a scenario where basically what I believe for the document S bomb

455
00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:55.289
Thomas Steenbergen: right? The right way is to in your S bomb

456
00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.040
Thomas Steenbergen: when you publish it, have some kind of link

457
00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:02.470
Thomas Steenbergen: pointing from like. Here is my vex information.

458
00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:04.760
Thomas Steenbergen: So I strongly

459
00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:11.920
Thomas Steenbergen: pros of, just like Anthony to include vexes in document

460
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:28.530
Thomas Steenbergen: S bombs that are like static and and can be downloadable like like Json File or Xml files. But you should link to where your vexes can be found, and that can be a vex api, or another system where you can find vexes. But the other case is where you have

461
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:33.642
Thomas Steenbergen: kind of like S bomb streams. So there's a continuous communication where?

462
00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:39.432
Thomas Steenbergen: what most people don't. Most people the standard use case is still

463
00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:43.849
Thomas Steenbergen: you have S-bomb document, but you can also make an S bombs of S bombs

464
00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:57.040
Thomas Steenbergen: where you link. Use the s 1 format to link things together, and then you can. It makes sense to links vex things together. Because then you can just basically communicate

465
00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:02.630
Thomas Steenbergen: via the same as bond techniques. You can communicate vex changes as well.

466
00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:19.470
Thomas Steenbergen: But I think this is the problem that most people don't understand the different way or different use cases. But this has to do that. Some of the organizations that we worked with use the S bomb standards like to internally communicate between as streams of data that are continuously flowing.

467
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:27.110
Thomas Steenbergen: But between organizations we have like external organizations. We haven't seen that yet.

468
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:29.790
Thomas Steenbergen: but that may be. Why.

469
00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:38.309
Thomas Steenbergen: there's a lot of confusion between facts inside s bomb. Not inside S bomb. I think they should be separated, but if there is an Api use case, they might be come together.

470
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:41.610
Thomas Steenbergen: I hope this helps.

471
00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:44.059
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you.

472
00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.610
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Sean. Do you have any

473
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:51.270
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): comment.

474
00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:54.990
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): or some other people?

475
00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:56.530
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I just noted that.

476
00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:56.880
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Oh, man!

477
00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:01.869
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I had a few comments earlier. Yari, might you want to speak to some of those.

478
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:12.059
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): Well, I guess I'm I'm just repeating what Thomas was just saying, that, you know, there might be

479
00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:17.650
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): good use cases when the vulnerability information, or the vex information is

480
00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.840
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): dynamic

481
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:26.839
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): within the the spom. But, on the other hand, at least for today I'm in the static spom

482
00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:31.760
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): and and dynamic vulnerability, or or vex vex camp. But

483
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:36.290
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): let's see, you know, we are still in early days, so how the

484
00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:38.230
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): industry will

485
00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:39.260
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): form.

486
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.640
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): I think we will see that. And well, maybe we are the ones who are forming the industry as well. So

487
00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:47.460
Jari Koivisto (OpenChain Project): let's let's take a stand here. Maybe.

488
00:46:54.300 --> 00:47:02.689
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, thank you. And actually, can I share one slide about the related to this topic.

489
00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.819
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): ninja side, can I share my screen.

490
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.840
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): You should be able to share it. Yeah, there you go.

491
00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:18.890
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Okay, okay.

492
00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:27.540
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, recently the bomb subgroup discussed about what should be needed to future discussion.

493
00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.075
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and a lady did it

494
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:33.470
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): previous topics.

495
00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:43.819
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It is dependent S form and effects depends on the context and the receiving, timing and the distributing time.

496
00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:54.509
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And we think when receiving timing, we should discuss maturity levels upstream entity.

497
00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.889
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This is very important.

498
00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:02.769
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And of course, security perspective and the license compliance perspective.

499
00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:07.800
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): What information we need is different.

500
00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:15.110
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So this r 1, from r. 1 to R. 3 should be discussed in the future.

501
00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:22.050
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and some parts have already discussed in many Islam subgroup.

502
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:24.100
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Understand?

503
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:32.139
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): What information do we manage inside our company. That's a security perspective on the license perspective.

504
00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:35.710
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And a big difference is the servicing time.

505
00:48:36.698 --> 00:48:40.202
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): When we ship the product to our software

506
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:47.449
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): usage of the software is defined by download and downstream companies.

507
00:48:47.930 --> 00:49:01.669
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So in this use case, specific use case, we needed to discuss about what information is needed to the downstream company downstream entity

508
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:04.639
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and a security perspective.

509
00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:10.479
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): What information do they company customer needed?

510
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:14.750
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): On the other hand, license, compliance, perspective?

511
00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:18.189
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): What information must we provide.

512
00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:21.520
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Then this is a license compliance, perspective.

513
00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:25.349
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So I illustrated

514
00:49:26.242 --> 00:49:37.090
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): change, the current maturity level of upstream entity and the different usage of software by download and downstream entity and the license compliance perspective.

515
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:42.650
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This 3 point is needed needed to be categorized.

516
00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:45.129
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And what information is needed.

517
00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:48.941
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Hey, we list. These

518
00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:53.469
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): from this perspective is important, I think.

519
00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:59.159
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): What this are there any comments or question comments.

520
00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:23.870
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): I think it would be interesting to look at what an end user needs, as I think, from another company, because I think the software supply chain

521
00:50:24.852 --> 00:50:33.640
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): in the upstream and downstream are probably very similar. But actually, what what does an end user really value?

522
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:39.229
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Is it? Is he, too? Both. Is he really bothered about the license as much as security?

523
00:50:39.711 --> 00:50:45.499
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): It would be interesting, you know, if I'm an end user, I'm more concerned about, am I vulnerable?

524
00:50:46.050 --> 00:50:46.870
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): And

525
00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:56.130
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): the license information is probably the risk, maybe not as great as the as a security risk.

526
00:50:58.193 --> 00:51:13.079
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, I agree. But cra requires us. For example, Cra requires us to provide s. 1 and back when we, for example, we ship the headphone.

527
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:17.009
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Cra required us to provide the estimate.

528
00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:24.360
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): but end user customers. When end user customers receive the bunch of as well.

529
00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:32.179
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): They don't they? I I think they don't want to receive such bunch of f 1 Json files.

530
00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:54.100
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): On the other hand, some companies buy the routers from the upstream company and connect their network and manage their it. Infrastructure. It is needed to be provided detailed information such as exponent, including bags, and so on.

531
00:51:54.530 --> 00:52:00.329
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This is depend. This depends on the context or usage of the downstream entities.

532
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:10.889
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So we needed to. I think it. It's my opinion, but we should separate these information from the use case.

533
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:12.710
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): What I think.

534
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:14.410
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Yeah, I think.

535
00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:32.140
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): And this is for debate as well, and I am not an advocate of having different S bombs for different end users. So say a regulator only gets a subset of an S bomb that you may pass to a another software organization.

536
00:52:32.587 --> 00:52:38.012
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): I'm a view that you provide the same S bomb to multiple users.

537
00:52:39.320 --> 00:53:01.319
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): how that user consumes the S bomb will depend on his use case. So it might be. If it's a light. If it's a compliance team, they're probably only going to be interested in the license information. If it's the security team they're going to be interested in the versions of the components. Maybe so. That would be an interesting view in terms of whether people think we should have

538
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:05.719
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): different viewpoints of an S bomb or not now.

539
00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:36.430
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): but I think we probably need more end users of S. Bombs to be involved. What do they value? I know, looking on the group. We've probably got various organizations who are providing products. But how do we, you know, do we have a an a end user? Let's say a government. How they would interpret, you know, what do they value within the S bomb? Now, that would be a really interesting discussion.

540
00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:48.050
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Right.

541
00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:48.760
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): To.

542
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:53.310
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Jimmy, do you have any opinion?

543
00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:55.820
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Can you share your opinion.

544
00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:09.609
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): I can certainly try, at least, so I I don't see that there needs to be a sort of either, or I think that's an ideal scenario. One S bomb can

545
00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:16.289
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): sort of both provide for for license, compliance, information as needed or license information as needed

546
00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:19.190
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): and the necessary information needed for

547
00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:24.649
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): security. And just as a reply to Anthony, I'm probably myself more

548
00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:29.189
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): concerned with licensing as an end user than I am

549
00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:35.339
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): security. But that doesn't mean that I that security is not important, or that there aren't people within my company

550
00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:40.170
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): that would certainly be more more interested and more concerned with security aspects.

551
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:41.230
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): But

552
00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:49.559
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): I I neither do I want to see sort of multiple S bombs depending on on the person. I would much

553
00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:52.590
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): rather prefer one s-bomb

554
00:54:53.111 --> 00:54:59.619
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): containing all the necessary information for the various use cases and various persona and user personas that will

555
00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:01.830
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): will consume that.

556
00:55:02.621 --> 00:55:08.649
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): And I I would also to stress that. And that was one of the points of of the telquest bomb

557
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:12.710
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): is really that we don't want to cater to

558
00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:15.919
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): necessarily multiple customers or multiple

559
00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:21.470
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): sort of receivers of this s pumps with their specific requirements.

560
00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.130
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): So instead of having one s-pop

561
00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:29.339
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): for that sector, or for that that kind of customer, and the same then

562
00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:34.079
Jimmy Ahlberg (Ericsson): for for people supplying in that value chain to simplify things.

563
00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:38.960
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you.

564
00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.240
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

565
00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:43.165
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And

566
00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:47.990
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): the next comment is.

567
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.270
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Stefan.

568
00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.710
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): can you share your thought?

569
00:55:56.703 --> 00:56:02.210
Stephen Pollard: Yes, yeah, thank you. Yeah. I was just very interested by your by the diagram here.

570
00:56:02.912 --> 00:56:08.127
Stephen Pollard: And I just wondered if there was a a use case that people could

571
00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:14.269
Stephen Pollard: envisage where a downstream company might actually require a dynamic S bomb.

572
00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:19.509
Stephen Pollard: because somehow the the delivery was quite closely integrated with the architecture upstream

573
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:22.639
Stephen Pollard: that would require a dynamic

574
00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:24.910
Stephen Pollard: Sbom service, as you described

575
00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:31.779
Stephen Pollard: someone else, I think, described like an Api stream. Are there any kind of use, cases that come to mind as to that. Would that would really

576
00:56:32.570 --> 00:56:34.240
Stephen Pollard: suggest that was needed.

577
00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:39.360
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Really

578
00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:49.120
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): sorry I don't have the

579
00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:50.250
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): profile

580
00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:51.560
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I'll serve.

581
00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:53.500
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Was there any

582
00:56:55.214 --> 00:56:59.750
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Are there any thoughts anyone does? Does anyone have any thought.

583
00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:17.092
Ummo Schwarting (Carl Zeiss AG): I mean, it probably depends on how the use of S from will continue in the future. I think this is kind of what we had as a discussion earlier with the security assessment.

584
00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:25.760
Ummo Schwarting (Carl Zeiss AG): I agree with with Thomas and where the discussion was going earlier that you don't want this too dynamic in the S bomb.

585
00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:40.836
Ummo Schwarting (Carl Zeiss AG): But where I see a use case is that you might want assessments in there, and this is something that we also discuss now for operations use where you might want to include export control information in the S. Bomber. At least link it to the S form. I think this is.

586
00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:56.029
Ummo Schwarting (Carl Zeiss AG): there's still no final say how to really do this. But this is an area. This is, in my, from my point of view, very new that in the past you were dealing with open source licenses where you would expect there wouldn't be much change over time.

587
00:57:56.040 --> 00:58:10.189
Ummo Schwarting (Carl Zeiss AG): But of course, with vulnerabilities, and also something like export control assessments. This might change in the future. So you would just put probably something like a timestamp on that information and say, okay, this was the assessment at that time.

588
00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:32.370
Ummo Schwarting (Carl Zeiss AG): Then I see. Use cases there that you will have these discussions in. I don't know customer intake control when you're supplying to other businesses that they want to see this in contract negotiation, that okay, at that point in time when we agree on the contract, there was this assessment, and this is now the risk attached to this.

589
00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:34.519
Ummo Schwarting (Carl Zeiss AG): Then, of course, you would need to

590
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:40.140
Ummo Schwarting (Carl Zeiss AG): come up with a way to supply this information dynamically, but I don't see this in

591
00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:48.680
Ummo Schwarting (Carl Zeiss AG): larger cycles. Then it's probably relevant for the actual vex information which you would use daily and system more

592
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:52.070
Ummo Schwarting (Carl Zeiss AG): kind of a topic for the technical departments.

593
00:58:52.190 --> 00:59:05.679
Ummo Schwarting (Carl Zeiss AG): whereas something like export control might change over time, and there you might have might see some kind of dynamic in these S bombs, but with longer cycles in between, maybe yearly update on on the assessment, or something like that.

594
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:13.510
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you very much. And you later, Han.

595
00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:26.899
Alin Jerpelea (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah, thank you. In my opinion, we will see something in between, because the companies have to pay to generate ice bonds. So that is a cost for them, and they will do the minimum

596
00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:29.429
Alin Jerpelea (Sony Group Corporation): requirements by law.

597
00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:35.530
Alin Jerpelea (Sony Group Corporation): So I personally think that we will have a mix between dynamic and static.

598
00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:55.299
Ummo Schwarting (Carl Zeiss AG): Yes, exactly. I think this is very dependent on on the actual use, case and agreement between companies. How they set up their contracts, what information should be provided and was consumed, or if you're responsible on your own to generate it.

599
00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:59.149
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you very much.

600
00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:03.040
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay. Last 7 min.

601
01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:05.679
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So are there any

602
01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.220
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): thoughts or comments.

603
01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:28.562
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Hello, yes, so thank you for the very good comparison between different documents. That is quite useful. So my question was,

604
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:33.359
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Now we have this many documents.

605
01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:39.610
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): So what do we want to achieve?

606
01:00:39.830 --> 01:00:47.109
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): Should we produce a document recommending how to

607
01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:50.245
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): adhere to this

608
01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:57.909
Marc-Etienne Vargenau (Nokia Corporation): different standards? And how do we proceed to to create it?

609
01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:04.940
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you. Do you have any comment on this.

610
01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:08.440
Takashi Ninjouji: From me from my side.

611
01:01:09.283 --> 01:01:10.230
Takashi Ninjouji: Yeah.

612
01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:13.570
Takashi Ninjouji: of.

613
01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:18.629
Takashi Ninjouji: I have also same questions to this community.

614
01:01:20.173 --> 01:01:21.099
Takashi Ninjouji: I'm sorry.

615
01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:21.680
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

616
01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:27.380
Takashi Ninjouji: Yeah.

617
01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:33.799
Takashi Ninjouji: So we're discussing on the Islam study groups to

618
01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.609
Takashi Ninjouji: treat the

619
01:01:36.463 --> 01:01:39.080
Takashi Ninjouji: issues, just marketing you some

620
01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:44.520
Takashi Ninjouji: pointed out or other aspects. We will another how to say

621
01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:49.249
Takashi Ninjouji: more prioritized issues for the s. 1 promotion were how to

622
01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:56.720
Takashi Ninjouji: make more enhance some quality or more automated initiatives. Also, I'm not sure but what is

623
01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:02.269
Takashi Ninjouji: important and how to lead the information sharing

624
01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:04.940
Takashi Ninjouji: in the software separate chain.

625
01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:12.160
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Does anyone does anyone have any thoughts.

626
01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:22.399
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Ito San has his hand.

627
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:30.240
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): Here. I what as I mentioned I think there

628
01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:31.280
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): already.

629
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:38.370
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): Is this the several purpose of this from already discussed in many place one in the

630
01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.580
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): some sort of national security

631
01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.950
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): and customer protection

632
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:49.499
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): and in exchange in Japan. It's from

633
01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:53.530
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): mentioned in the sentence of the

634
01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:56.380
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): industrial promotion

635
01:02:57.890 --> 01:03:03.217
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): for example, s form utilizing s form in export control

636
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:07.149
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): mentioned in this meeting. That

637
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:14.879
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): that's related related in some aspects in the industry promotion and national security.

638
01:03:15.546 --> 01:03:16.143
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): So

639
01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:18.440
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): it's though.

640
01:03:19.263 --> 01:03:19.956
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): similar

641
01:03:21.167 --> 01:03:24.502
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): target of this form already exists. And perhaps

642
01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:27.600
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): we have put more

643
01:03:29.814 --> 01:03:36.350
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): methodology required to to fulfill those requirements. Perhaps more

644
01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:40.019
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): requirement, more target of the S from

645
01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:44.400
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): might be promoted in future. So.

646
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:46.769
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): but we have

647
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:49.990
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): to check the many

648
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:52.640
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): corresponds

649
01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:57.180
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): on each industry, each public sector, and many, many

650
01:03:57.835 --> 01:04:02.434
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): correspond people. Perhaps. It might be

651
01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:04.180
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): improve

652
01:04:04.310 --> 01:04:07.250
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): more member in

653
01:04:07.790 --> 01:04:08.750
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): in the world.

654
01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:10.013
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): But

655
01:04:12.585 --> 01:04:20.250
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): concluded, today's document, and after

656
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.650
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): quite useful to start the discussion about those

657
01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:28.429
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): how we treat the S form.

658
01:04:29.410 --> 01:04:31.500
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): or for each entity

659
01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:32.710
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): of this one

660
01:04:33.233 --> 01:04:38.199
Yoshiyuki Ito (Renesas Electronics Corporation): supplier to in the in the sales supply chain. I think.

661
01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:42.990
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you, Josephone.

662
01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.330
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I know.

663
01:04:44.842 --> 01:04:51.629
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you. Very good discussion. But we will have only 2 min. So

664
01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:54.710
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): you think, can we

665
01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:56.870
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): across this meeting.

666
01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:57.720
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yeah.

667
01:04:58.734 --> 01:04:59.750
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah.

668
01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:01.130
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): No choice.

669
01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:04.100
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Is it.

670
01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:11.889
