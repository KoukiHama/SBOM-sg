19
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:29.070
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Actually, I have before we officially start, I have an important topic related to the onsen study group.

20
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.500
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes!

21
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.440
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yes, because of your encouragement, I have started to explore more onsense.

22
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.659
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Oh, waiter!

23
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:47.510
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yes, I found some near my house that also have working spaces. So a whole new

24
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.979
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): whole new time has been discovered.

25
00:04:11.615 --> 00:04:14.535
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Kubotus, and I know you have some slides

26
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:16.510
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes.

27
00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.739
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Do your slides have the antitrust policy notice, and so on.

28
00:04:23.034 --> 00:04:25.566
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Sorry I didn't.

29
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.350
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Sorry.

30
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:36.599
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): No, not at all. What I'll do is I will share a slide with the antitrust policy to start the meeting.

31
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.010
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and then I will hand over to you so.

32
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.740
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you.

33
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.840
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): One second we'll begin sharing our slides. I see we have

34
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.919
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): a lot of people on the call today. So that's wonderful.

35
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.970
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): All right.

36
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.920
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So everyone. Welcome.

37
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.699
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Welcome to another open chain. Sbom, study group. Call this call today is

38
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:18.290
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): obviously going to be a busy one for those of you who are new. Our Sbom study group started

39
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.240
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): around the second half of last year

40
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:30.650
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): to talk about how, in very practical ways we can use S-bombs in the supply chain.

41
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.120
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So our topic is higher level than discussing

42
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.150
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): a format per se. It's about, how

43
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:47.549
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): do we use Sulphur bill of materials in the supply chain. What's needed? What might be a quality

44
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.550
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): software bill of material? What are the challenges, as usual? Then?

45
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.379
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): A big topic, a high level topic, a typical open chain topic.

46
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:21.780
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): This meeting, like every other meeting in the Open Chain project and every other meeting across the Linux Foundation, is held under the Lf. Antitrust policy. You can find the full policy on the Linux Foundation website. If you're from a member company, you can ask any questions of our Council, Andrew up to Grove.

47
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.739
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and if you're not from a member company, you can ask any questions of your own counsel.

48
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:34.349
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Long story short, it's a way that we have clear rules to allow us to collaborate openly.

49
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:44.939
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Now, without further ado, I'm going to hand over to the chair of the Sbom Study group, Kubotusan from Sony. He's also

50
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.460
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the voting representative for Sony, which is a platinum member of the Open Chain project.

51
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.359
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Indeed, on this call we have a Who's Who of Open chain members

52
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:09.080
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): picking randomly. We have Watanabe-san from Hitachi, who's a board member, but also the chair of the open chain, Japan planning sub working group.

53
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.040
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We have ninjoji-sen.

54
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.520
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Who's with Honda?

55
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.840
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We have Marcel with Bosch.

56
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.609
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and there's many names on the screen. So I'm going to pick 2 more and then stop.

57
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:33.239
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We have a Wadasan who has arranged and hosted many meetings. He's from Socionext and Yari, a frequent community collaborator based in Switzerland, right?

58
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:42.339
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Lots of people, lots of discussion to be had, and our chair, Kubota-san from Sony, will guide this discussion. Kubota-san, over to you.

59
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.509
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you, Shane.

60
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:52.410
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Today. I'd like to share my screen. And can you see my screen.

61
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.460
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yes, it's looking great.

62
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.630
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, thank you.

63
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:10.859
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And Hello, everyone. And Happy New Year. It's a little late. But it is our 1st time meeting this year for s 1 study group.

64
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.500
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And I

65
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:26.979
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): remember that last year we studied as bomb study group, as Shane explained. And we had a host time this meetings last year.

66
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:46.749
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and we learned a lot from the several activities around the S bomb. And someone explained from the Wasp perspective or some Telco activities about the S-bomb Telco guide, and so on.

67
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:56.090
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So today, I'd like to propose what's next for this S bomb study group.

68
00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:04.397
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And oh, personally. And for Sony Group Corporation, we are now

69
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:12.929
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): challenging to implement to create and operate the s-bone matters.

70
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:18.940
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But actually, we have many challenges.

71
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:24.670
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and there are many guidelines or regulations around the world.

72
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.510
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It's very useful. But we still have some challenges.

73
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:42.800
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And I think, and for Japanese S bombs subgroup we had some many discussions among the Japanese people.

74
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.280
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and many members say similar situations.

75
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:59.509
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So today, I'd like to propose to cater, or pick up some challenges that we still have.

76
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:14.229
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So, firstly, I'd like to share our studies, and after that, please comment. Or please let us please share your perspective.

77
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:20.170
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, so we I'll start my presentation.

78
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:26.329
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I think it, and there's some discussion will be occurred. But I

79
00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:36.839
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): can't. I? I think I can't catch up with native or English speakers discussion. But please proceed the discussion.

80
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:50.229
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I will check the recordings and transcripts after the meeting, and I will catch up my discussions and summarize as a meeting notes afterwards.

81
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:51.500
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And

82
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:53.210
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I'm sorry.

83
00:10:53.390 --> 00:11:03.250
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Oh, sorry, Kubota San. I was just going to say I'll be here on the line to help as well. So if people ask anything

84
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:15.499
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): that's difficult to understand for non-native speaker. I'll be here to help catch the question and summarize it for our discussion.

85
00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:17.260
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you.

86
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.330
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, let's get started.

87
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:30.389
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay? And firstly, I think I needed to explain some definitions. And as a background

88
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:39.250
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): after this slide I use. I will use these icons and keywords.

89
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:46.629
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And I think it would be good to express whole world. Whole definitions.

90
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:56.650
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): 1st one is Spoon Sbom. In this slide, Sbom means software component information itself.

91
00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:03.519
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Sometimes we discuss about the S bomb. We use S bomb.

92
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:17.449
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But someone explained S bomb, especially from the vulnerability or security perspective. Someone use S bomb as a software component information itself.

93
00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:24.550
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Usually it is populated in the database or some kind of system.

94
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.590
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And another one is S bomb document.

95
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:37.800
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This is this means a file that contains software component information in a specific format

96
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.290
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): such as Spdx or Cyclone Dx.

97
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:47.959
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): At a next one is public source packages.

98
00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.330
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This means that the source code package.

99
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:57.180
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): whose source code is publicly available on

100
00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.689
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): such as Github or Github, and so on.

101
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.489
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And another next one is a private source package.

102
00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:13.570
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This means a source code package that is shared only between 2 or more specific parties

103
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.420
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and the source code is not publicly available.

104
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.629
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Now, the other icons are understandable.

105
00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.540
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): leading the world and the icons, I think.

106
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:41.090
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And this is today's proposal from me and from Japan working group as well.

107
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:51.300
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This as from study group, I'd like to discuss, not the quality of the software information itself

108
00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:55.240
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): being managed during that development process.

109
00:13:55.420 --> 00:14:00.110
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): but rather focus on the quality of the Sbom document.

110
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.150
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I explained previous.

111
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:04.240
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): That's right.

112
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.549
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It is exchanged between 2 or more different parties.

113
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:19.820
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This means that sometimes spom quality means that I'll explain next slide.

114
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:24.500
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And what is a high quality spom document.

115
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:32.829
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and interlink provided a description of the high quality s-bone.

116
00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.619
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): a high quality ass pump should apply, apply

117
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:52.109
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): upright support, managing software assets, license information and interact property as well as providing a base for configuration, management, vulnerability, handling and incident response.

118
00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:01.969
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This means, in short, the quality of the Sbom document depends on whether the Sbom document

119
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:12.920
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): contains information that uniquely identifies software and license, interactive property and vulnerability information and so on.

120
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:23.819
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So I'd like to focus on the quality of the Sbom document in this Sbom study group.

121
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:34.619
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So if you have any objection or some opinion, please. Let me know, let us know.

122
00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:43.790
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, so when we sync the high quality Sbom document.

123
00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:52.780
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I think we need to break down the source software supply chain from source to binary.

124
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.000
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): the lead sack inside of the lead, sack

125
00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:03.370
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): sars, diagram shows that producer provides a source code package.

126
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:10.929
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and I build with some dependencies, and after that generates a binary packages.

127
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.700
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So in this workflow.

128
00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.150
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I listed all actors.

129
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:30.710
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I will not explain everything. But firstly, some parties

130
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:43.780
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): output public source packages like Oss developers or Oss communities and someone produce private source packages.

131
00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:48.160
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And this means similar to the proprietary software.

132
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.330
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and after that someone modify it

133
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:57.939
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and provide modified source code packages to another parties

134
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:09.204
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and someone uses a public software or a private software kind of provide. And some

135
00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:13.480
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): packages to another parties.

136
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:23.920
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And this in these operations. There are no requirement to provide the Cibel.

137
00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:33.079
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I think it's of course it is useful, somewhat useful, to provide the S bomb with source code packages.

138
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:43.130
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): but it's not required, and we can investigate some information software information with the software source code packages.

139
00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:53.307
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): On the other hand, source will be built in binary format in such case

140
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:59.889
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): some binary packages are provided with Sbom document.

141
00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:12.070
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and as someone aggregate binary packages into some distribution distribution with many spom documents.

142
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.970
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And this is a example on

143
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.580
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): for the development chain for public source packages.

144
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:30.759
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Someone this is very small icons. So please let check later.

145
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:37.659
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But someone produced public source code packages and someone modify it.

146
00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:45.570
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): After that, someone build it with and provides a binary back cases with S bomb document.

147
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:58.979
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And someone just as a source code packages and aggregate source code packages. And someone built in a 1. Binary packages

148
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:10.329
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): after that binary package is aggregated and the cassibly used used build a process the cassibly.

149
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:15.969
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This is an example of a development chain for public source packages.

150
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.460
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and this is a simplified oss package distributor.

151
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:35.130
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So someone well, it's same someone build into binary packages and aggregate some back binary packages and build it with

152
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:40.649
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): other public source code packages with some dependencies.

153
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:49.329
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Finally, some open source software package distributor provide many binary packages with Spo document.

154
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.719
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and this is a proprietary application creator.

155
00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:05.390
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): In many cases, propriety, application, creator, create their own private source packages.

156
00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:18.539
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And it's many cases. In many cases it depends on many open source public software packages in the dependency with many dependencies.

157
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:26.359
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and they finally build and provides a binary packages with S form document

158
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:35.089
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): in this case, Oss. Package dispute distributor will provide some spom document

159
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:44.820
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and a propriety application. Creator matches S bomb document into their own S bomb document.

160
00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.820
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): In this case we face some challenges.

161
00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.660
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And this is one example.

162
00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:00.890
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): We face one challenge identity program.

163
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:16.549
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): open source, public software distributors use different names, open source software use different names and versions in many cases, and are making it difficult to identify the same packages.

164
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:27.769
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This means that, for example, letterhead provides legacy packages and ubuntu provide the same legacy packages.

165
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:37.279
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): but the package, name and versions are written in the defined format in the Espo.

166
00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:47.890
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): so it is a little difficult to find out same packages from only with S. Bones

167
00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.580
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): as bomb document.

168
00:21:50.390 --> 00:22:00.579
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So in this case there is one possibility to use a purl or a software, hedge, id, and so on.

169
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:07.050
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This is a simple questions and challenges, and the next one

170
00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:21.210
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): is a proprieties. It is the same example, proprietary application Creator. But this application Creator, receive also proprietary library distributor.

171
00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:33.359
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): propriety. If the proprietary library distributor created a propriety library with many open source software packages.

172
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.830
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): they provide the S-bomb document to the application Creator.

173
00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:41.770
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But

174
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:51.590
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): as far as I know, there is no rules or no format to describe the private source package information.

175
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.149
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This is one big challenge. I think.

176
00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:00.559
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So. This is a definition program.

177
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:06.200
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): What should we view the private package information in Spom document?

178
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:14.240
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): There are no, there are no 3rd package 3rd party, verifiable package name and Belgium

179
00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:22.210
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and the the proprietary software don't have Prl or software heritage. Id.

180
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.129
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This is a challenge.

181
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:37.780
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This is an example. So I'd like to propose the listing the challenges in the Github discussions

182
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:45.250
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and share your challenges in spom document challenges category.

183
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:52.829
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And after that later challenges. If you have similar challenges and share your solution idea in the thread.

184
00:23:54.070 --> 00:24:03.079
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And I created as Github discussions in the S bomb study group Github Repository.

185
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.560
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Hello! This is a sample challenge.

186
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:19.137
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This example is, I've already explained, proprietary application. Creator achieves a proprietary library distributor in this case.

187
00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:26.119
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): what should we? This is a challenges and share the solution idea.

188
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:34.650
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): provide the following information for all included software, public software and private software with spom document.

189
00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:46.289
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And in this case we should provide fields, and we should define fields and value or public software component

190
00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.620
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): light like upper side.

191
00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.830
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): We should provide we expect

192
00:24:55.930 --> 00:25:00.410
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): it is very useful to identify the software packages.

193
00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:06.459
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Unique id, it means purl or software heritage Id, and so on.

194
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:12.360
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): The public software has Prl or software heritage Id, I think.

195
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:22.170
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and a package name should be the provided public software distributor and version is also provided public software distributor

196
00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:30.469
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and the dependencies at the ideal, providing a delivery item or a complete item

197
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.809
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): defined in the BSI tr. 0, 3, 1, 8, 3 document

198
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:49.339
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and a timestamp is when the binary package was built and a component hash is a actual binary. Package is hash value of the binary package.

199
00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:58.240
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and the license information is provided should be provided, declared, and concluded with the Spdx short identifier.

200
00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:04.350
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): On the other hand, it's recommended to provide the contact information.

201
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:11.419
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This is a little ambiguous, as every guideline or definitions.

202
00:26:12.053 --> 00:26:12.486
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But

203
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:21.220
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Public software has some separate some open source software originator information.

204
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:31.020
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But we need this in this case we need a supplier information and also

205
00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:38.969
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): builder configuration should be is recommended to provide in the Sbop document.

206
00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:46.179
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): on the other hand, for private software required. Items are like this

207
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:51.310
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): unique Id is not private software doesn't have a

208
00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:58.270
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Prl or software heritage. Id. So any unique id defined by the supplier

209
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.960
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and package name and budget also defined by the supplier.

210
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:15.590
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But we need a contact information, actual contact information from the supplier for the Supplier. So company, name or email address, and so on, is required

211
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.019
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and the dependencies.

212
00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:25.850
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Private software has many dependencies. But it is difficult to describe.

213
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:31.059
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): That's delivery item or complete item.

214
00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:39.550
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And the delivery item on the complete item, dependence is provided in the public software as Com.

215
00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:45.889
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So we need only top level dependencies for the private software.

216
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:58.349
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And this is my opinion, it's enough to provide that top level, and a timestamp and a component hash is also provide should be provided.

217
00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:02.829
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and the license information is a difficult. So

218
00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.619
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): proprietary is one option, I think.

219
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:24.809
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and also sometimes the proprietary software provider can't reveal or can't disclose a build of configuration so on. But we should. It is recommended to provide such information.

220
00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:31.450
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This is a sample of the creating the challenges and solution idea.

221
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:40.870
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And I create your challenge is freely in this. Keep up discussions

222
00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:51.099
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and continue to discussions and share your idea for solutions, solved challenges, and so on.

223
00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:59.910
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And once we conclude, or we can agree to the solution.

224
00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:08.969
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It's a 1 indicator for the Sbom document quality. I think

225
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:15.600
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): so. I'd like to propose all over you to

226
00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:22.070
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): create the your share your challenges in the Github discussions.

227
00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.510
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): This is today's my proposal.

228
00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.546
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, at this moment, at

229
00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:41.249
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): this is all from my side, so please share your idea or your opinion.

230
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.860
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I see we have 2 comments so far in the chat

231
00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:59.439
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): now. Everyone, of course, can also unmute themselves. Anthony had a comment that purl is already looking at how to include

232
00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:07.110
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): private or proprietary software. So this is a comment from Anthony.

233
00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:15.140
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I'm not sure if Anthony, you want to give us just a little bit more background on that, so that we can

234
00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:17.970
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): explore the topic.

235
00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.670
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): You can unmute yourself if you want.

236
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.610
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Hello! Hello! Can you hear me?

237
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:24.670
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yes.

238
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:25.489
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Name it.

239
00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:26.610
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yes, we can hear.

240
00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:34.855
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): And okay. So pearl is the old at the open source, ecosystems and

241
00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:46.120
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): the challenge you have is proprietary software, which is currently the things like the national publicity database. Mvd have Cpe

242
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:50.819
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): where you have like a vendor and the product name.

243
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:55.379
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): And if you because Cpe is

244
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:59.630
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): not maintain, not be well maintained, and then managed.

245
00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:03.690
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): need to come up with a way of having

246
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.230
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): a good way of managing propriety. Software

247
00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:10.730
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): that is managed by the proprietary software producer.

248
00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:19.501
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): I'm not 100% certain where it's getting to. But I know they've been looking at, maybe using

249
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.910
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): a different namespace, maybe a squid namespace.

250
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:31.780
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): because I think a lot of proprietary software has a software id identifier

251
00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:45.280
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): or it might be using a Dns, you know, like a you know microsoft.com as a as a name, and then you see my Microsoft com slash windows slash 11 or whatever

252
00:31:46.809 --> 00:31:52.240
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): I mean post them next week in Brussels. I will have a discussion with the

253
00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:55.219
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): some of the people who are looking at Pearl

254
00:31:55.654 --> 00:32:02.760
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): so I might know a little bit more about what they are. But I know proprietary software is still is very much on their horizon.

255
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.520
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): because they would like to come up with a single

256
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.920
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): standard that addresses proprietary and open source software.

257
00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:18.529
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Thank you very much, Anthony. That's some useful background, and it would be deeply appreciated.

258
00:32:19.119 --> 00:32:26.419
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Once, you, you know, have some more information from the upcoming meetings. If you could

259
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:31.539
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): update us on the mailing list to help guide the discussion into the next month.

260
00:32:33.946 --> 00:32:37.670
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Yeah, we'll try and do that. Yeah, there's a lot happening. But yeah.

261
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:46.509
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): That's absolutely fantastic. You're you know. It's it's really good to have you connect us with that information.

262
00:32:50.400 --> 00:33:01.379
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We also have a comment from Yari Yari just noted that package hash should come from the distributor, too. So it's it's a comment from Yari.

263
00:33:04.919 --> 00:33:08.690
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Everyone else. The floor is open. If you want.

264
00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:18.600
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): If you want to unmute, you're very welcome to share ideas and comments, as Kubota-san said, based on his presentation.

265
00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:22.150
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Can I? Can I come in again?

266
00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:23.810
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Of course.

267
00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:30.699
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): I don't think we need to make any difference between proprietary and

268
00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:37.579
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): open source software. I think we need all software to be the same considered the same.

269
00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:49.930
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Add, I know there's a there's a little bit of concern about contractual information being shared, I think

270
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:57.739
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): you know. So that said, we look to. So you know, people leave revealing, you know, sensitive information.

271
00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:03.120
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): But I think that can be handled outside. You know.

272
00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:08.270
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): document that can help that can be handled by a legal contract.

273
00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:14.020
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): I think we should be having a document that has the information which supports transparency.

274
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:23.280
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): and then how that document is shared is a separate separate discussion issue.

275
00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:31.079
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): So when you started the discussion about focusing on the sharing of the document.

276
00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:34.809
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): I was wondering what you were thinking about

277
00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:38.290
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): where that was going to go.

278
00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:40.949
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Didn't see.

279
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.340
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Are we looking to say that we? We want to share

280
00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:56.320
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): document with 2 people different, you know a different set of parties. We may have different ways different bits of information about the shared with party. A. Different to party. B.

281
00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:06.230
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): What's your what's your thoughts or do? My personal view is, we have the same document for everybody, but I don't know whether there's any what what people think about that.

282
00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.880
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): I raised my hand. Can I directly jump in?

283
00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:16.639
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Can you hear me.

284
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.473
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yes, we can hear you.

285
00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.220
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Doesn't, says No, yes, you can.

286
00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:37.989
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Okay, thank you. So yes and no. I would say, what you say. So yes, from this what you said about contracts. So that, yeah, potentially well, this is

287
00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:47.320
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): information that is typically not shared because it's also the contractual situation. Also, from what you said that we should have the same structure in the document.

288
00:35:47.360 --> 00:36:11.549
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): I think that we do not distinguish between proprietary and and public there. As as a envelope, more or less I would also agree. But there is one aspect, and therefore I also like the this setup you showed now here with the challenges. Because here I think we need to distinguish especially what we observe

289
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:34.529
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): for public software. Obviously, we also have public sources for vulnerabilities. For example, right? But for proprietary software there are cases where the supplier only shares the vulnerability information obviously only with his customers or his users, and and that is not made public. There may be also cases in between.

290
00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:46.599
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): but in in that case I think it would be necessary also to distinguish between public information and and and proprietary information at that point. Yeah.

291
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:59.190
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): So, as I said, yes and no and also what we we observed the same thing here, and what we did is we

292
00:36:59.763 --> 00:37:27.970
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): we tried to also distinguish not only the S bomb from that direction or this disclosure documents from that direction of is it. Now a source. S bomb, build, s bomb, whatever S bomb like. I think it was an anti Ioc definition, but we try to distinguish it from exactly what you just mentioned with this, what is the overall information that we have

293
00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:29.610
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): ourselves.

294
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:41.530
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): and what is what we share? Right? Because there might be an difference right the the information that we collect and and manage and things that we we share.

295
00:37:41.680 --> 00:38:05.919
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): for example, only in business to business cases. If there's a contractual agreement. Or finally, then, to the end user, because to the end user from the open source license perspective, typically you only need to fulfill obligations. Right? So. And you don't need to proactively do things so that might be a a real

296
00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:18.709
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): minimal subset of what you really have as an information and also from security perspective that might also be counterproductive. If you share too much right to to open them as a attack, vector something like that.

297
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:28.939
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): And therefore we we tried to have also this other dimension of, Okay, this is everything we have.

298
00:38:29.503 --> 00:38:34.580
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): And these are the portions that we share with specific target groups.

299
00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.150
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Thank you, Marcel.

300
00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:47.970
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Does anyone else have any comments on this topic?

301
00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:02.900
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): Enlightened people.

302
00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.290
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Oh, sorry, Tony, over to you.

303
00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:11.670
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): I thought I thought the the Sdbs

304
00:39:12.185 --> 00:39:18.040
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): allowed you to define your own user defined licenses, and that could for me is a propriety license.

305
00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:21.850
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): So

306
00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:29.989
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): yes, and it would be, you know. It would be nice if you could have that as a little as a as a tag to save users.

307
00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.680
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): This is proprietary or commercial.

308
00:39:33.283 --> 00:39:40.159
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): But I think I don't think that's a big challenge to to make that. I'm sure that could be accommodated.

309
00:39:40.921 --> 00:39:43.180
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): In the existing guest. Pub

310
00:39:44.277 --> 00:39:49.860
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): documents. So I don't see the licensing being particularly challenging.

311
00:39:50.553 --> 00:39:52.669
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): I certainly I'm aware of

312
00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:59.290
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): a number of estrom tools that you know do support commercial licenses.

313
00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:09.929
Anthony Harrison (Not Applicable): So we can flag those up when they do, you know, do scanning of software. So that must be, mustn't be too difficult to accommodate.

314
00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:30.069
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, sorry wrong. Yes, this is just an example. So that's when you say it's it is a challenge. So I'd like to propose, create the challenges in at here.

315
00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:36.852
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And we discuss, continue to discuss on this, get to have discussions. And if

316
00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:47.760
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): we explore the practical solutions, or what Leshiba or

317
00:40:48.745 --> 00:40:52.620
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): implementer needed. What information needed.

318
00:40:55.070 --> 00:41:02.680
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Today's my proposal is share these challenges.

319
00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:13.240
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So I'd like to ask or for you to share your challenges. Adhere.

320
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:19.010
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So it's okay. One. I'm not sure.

321
00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:40.250
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So in this case, Kubota sen. I understand, then, that you'd welcome just an open and informal discussion about the challenges. And on this Github

322
00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:47.930
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): document. We can just add it directly. Could you put the link into the chat so that we have it.

323
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:49.260
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay.

324
00:41:55.330 --> 00:42:04.279
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Fantastic. And and for those of you who are new, because we have a lot of people dialing in. And I'm sure a lot of people watching the recording.

325
00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:10.980
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Kobodistan is very literal when he says, you know.

326
00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:19.189
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): add your challenges, your notes, your thoughts, open chains. Whole way of acting is that we? We just do this.

327
00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:25.410
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So, Komodo-san, you have a sample challenge there. I see.

328
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:27.000
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes.

329
00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:38.844
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): this is just a sample, and I already locked this this. This is just a example. So I already logged. But

330
00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:45.789
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): welcome to the new challenges. And we we'd like to

331
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:51.140
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): exchange a discussion on this Github discussions.

332
00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:57.119
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): The background is many Japanese today. Many Japanese

333
00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.288
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): kindly join these meetings, and

334
00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:11.120
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): of course, including me. I'm not good at English Discussion Directory.

335
00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:17.270
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So it's somewhat useful to discuss on the online.

336
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:40.539
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And of course, these are there are free format to describe the your thoughts. So it is very beneficial. And these discussions are stored in the Github on the Github, so we can live afterwards. Before after the discussion is closed, and so on.

337
00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:45.059
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): It is very transparent, transparent. I think

338
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:55.879
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): so today, I'd like to propose to using this Github discussions for exchange the challenges and solution ideas.

339
00:43:59.209 --> 00:44:04.400
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): You showed earlier this the, this overview of symbols that you're using?

340
00:44:05.148 --> 00:44:11.569
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Could you show this again? Is there also a symbol for metadata repositories or databases.

341
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:24.649
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): because I think that would be helpful also to put that into the picture. To say, Is it, is it a is, are there public meta databases available? Be it licenses, vulnerabilities, you name it.

342
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:47.329
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): And if you have local ones like, we just had this discussion. Obviously your proprietary contracts you would not share publicly. But you would have this locally, because I think from from this sharing of data and availability of data publicly and and locally, I think there also arise a lot of challenges. With that.

343
00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:25.359
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Marcel, I have a follow-up question about the challenges just for illustration purposes. Could you perhaps give an example of the type of challenges? And this is for the people who might be new to the whole Sbom topic, and are just coming up to speed.

344
00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.930
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Yeah. So if I look at this sample challenge, yeah.

345
00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:43.540
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): So the question there is, what should we fill? Should we fill the private package information in S bomb document no 3rd party, verifiable package name version, and know what Perl and so.

346
00:45:44.400 --> 00:46:04.170
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): coming back to this example, for example, with the vulnerabilities. Right? You have a public vulnerability database, or you have a vendor where you buy this vulnerability information from. And there's exactly where it's important that we use the same identifier, for example, Perl.

347
00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:24.899
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): all through the whole supply chain. Right? So if the action 2 uses a different identifier than action, 18. And they all want to check from the spom. Okay, is there any entry in the meta database in this case? Vulnerability database? And yeah, either you have a

348
00:46:25.468 --> 00:46:50.180
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): a public database that has all potential identifiers for the same component. Or and that would be ideal if we all use the same identifiers so for open source packages, I think that is something that we could reach. And I think with pro, we already or a software heritage hash, id, we're really on a good, a good way. But what about all those

349
00:46:51.960 --> 00:47:03.399
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): private in brackets? Slash proprietary things right? Because if I hand over some library that is proprietary through the supply chain

350
00:47:03.923 --> 00:47:11.589
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): and there's an availability so and and for me locally, I provided, or I created such an id for that.

351
00:47:12.149 --> 00:47:30.129
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): I feedback to the supplier, and then he would then also publish this vulnerability to all his users. So all those other users would 1st need to search for this component because they are not using the same identify

352
00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:32.499
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): as an example.

353
00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:45.122
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): So this is a challenge right? Of how? How do we identify all through the supply chain the components? Not for the public ones. As I said, I think they're in a good way. But I think here.

354
00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:50.030
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): it's it's a challenge to handle. Then also the

355
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:53.659
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): the propriety parts that are typically hidden away from the public.

356
00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:10.830
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And I remember, that represents proprietary software in near future. So

357
00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:20.209
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): are there any chance to specify the specific proprietary packages by using the Prl.

358
00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:30.639
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Oh, sorry! Anthony has already left.

359
00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:32.510
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Yeah.

360
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:33.630
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Then I try.

361
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:34.009
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I took it.

362
00:48:34.010 --> 00:49:02.649
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): My 2 cents it depends who is creating the initial Prl, right? Because you can use Prl as as a format for the identifier. But you. If if you use the same library, then we use it. So we internally could create a purel for this component, and you could create one, it would be the same component. It would both in both cases have a purel, but would not be the same.

363
00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:05.100
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Hmm, okay.

364
00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.740
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): okay.

365
00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:22.683
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): sorry. I'm not sure the exact Pr specification at this moment. I understand that the Pr is a global unique identifier.

366
00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:33.149
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So I I don't have the answer there at this moment, but I will check the pr specification later.

367
00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:46.610
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Yeah. Just as an example, you you would add the domain, for example, in the beginning, right? And as you would have suppliers at Sony, you would

368
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:50.940
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): add, as a 1st section in the Prl. We would

369
00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:55.680
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): at a sony supplier and then continue with your identifier

370
00:49:56.053 --> 00:50:22.070
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): for the same component Bosch, for example, would potentially put as a domain Bosch supplier right? And even if it's the same component so we would have one supplier one pearl with exactly the same where that starts with Sony supplier, and another one with for the same component that starts with Bosch supplier. And and here I think we would then need to, if we would know of about each other, or our supplier would

371
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:33.639
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): invite all the the customers to to use a pearl for their component this is something that would need to be aligned right? So that

372
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:56.339
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): if I don't know which supplier X would distribute their proprietary parts to Sony and to Bosch, and they distribute it directly with the pearl that they define locally, so also that they say, if there is any incident with vulnerabilities whatever. We will also publish this or distribute that media data with exactly this Prl.

373
00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:04.370
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): and I don't know if this is already happening. But this would be something, I think, as a as a precondition that we can really

374
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.010
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): yeah.

375
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:13.160
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Not only use the Prl as A as a format, but also having this unique identification in

376
00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:17.790
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): in shared databases, you know, even if that's a

377
00:51:18.582 --> 00:51:36.300
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): closed or not publicly shared, but only shared with a certain target group, as, for example, this, the customers of that supplier. But for public available open source or also freeware, whatever everything that is publicly, I think that

378
00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:42.789
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): is, then not an issue. I think that's only comes. That challenge only comes with this

379
00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:46.019
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): limitation, you know, of access.

380
00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:52.469
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): So perhaps we should also make everything open source. Then we would not have that too much, but I think there.

381
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.830
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes.

382
00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:56.593
Marcel Kurzmann (Bosch): Some some people that have other Adc.

383
00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:01.580
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, thank you.

384
00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:09.235
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, okay. And anyway, I will.

385
00:52:10.696 --> 00:52:21.883
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): we gathered, I get it. We gather we Sony gathered some actual challenges for implementing S bomb system operating system.

386
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:34.263
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And I will put some challenge after this meetings. So I appreciate to share your challenges in here at here.

387
00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:44.210
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So after that we I hope we can exchange the solution idea or some challenges out here.

388
00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:59.769
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So Kubota Sen, am I correct that? Basically, we will be

389
00:52:59.890 --> 00:53:08.239
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): moving the conversation for the next month hopefully onto this document to encourage challenges to be listed.

390
00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.399
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, I hope so.

391
00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:14.580
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): On my side.

392
00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:24.579
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): After this meeting. One thing I'll do for later this week or next week is start promoting

393
00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:33.619
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): this onto our social media as well, so that we can encourage more contributors.

394
00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:36.300
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you very much.

395
00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:54.849
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): and the purpose of the exchanging challenges is as a shame mentioned, or some we hope to create some aspen quality guide based on the Terrico S-prom guide.

396
00:53:55.620 --> 00:54:02.669
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Before that, I'd like to know? There are actual challenges we still have.

397
00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:11.109
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So I appreciate your contributions, or sharing the challenges or information.

398
00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:26.950
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I suppose, as well. One interesting point here is that there are now several different formats for Sbom.

399
00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.210
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): like SWID.

400
00:54:29.590 --> 00:54:32.790
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Spdx, cyclone. Dx.

401
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:39.409
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): We have requirements in the Us. Like the Ntia

402
00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:48.770
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): in Germany, and I believe in Japan.

403
00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:53.689
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So it seems like it's a very.

404
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:57.269
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Good time to at the high level.

405
00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:05.180
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Try to ask in a practical sense, what do we need in this supply chain? What are your challenges.

406
00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:12.960
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): So it's it just seems very timely to try to bring together the overview. And I must thank you for that. Kubotasan.

407
00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:21.933
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): No, no, that's my pleasure. And the challenge the big challenge, I think is

408
00:55:23.168 --> 00:55:25.281
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): bar. Oh, sorry volumes.

409
00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:33.040
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Spdx and cycletx defines fields and a format of the value.

410
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:42.110
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): But we face the challenges, what should be filled in the other field value.

411
00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:47.200
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So I'd like to discuss what

412
00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:52.670
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): values should be filled in for each field.

413
00:55:53.750 --> 00:56:04.030
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So sometimes in in some context, it should be changed. We should feel, what kind of values should be field.

414
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:13.680
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): So we, I'd like to discuss about the value of the each field in near future.

415
00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:20.669
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Okay, thank you.

416
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:22.170
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Thank you.

417
00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:23.639
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yeah, yeah.

418
00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:28.979
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): May I ask one last question, which is building on what happened today?

419
00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:44.070
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): It seems that there are some opinions, but also some challenges with describing proprietary and open source.

420
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:49.010
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): and you know, according to Anthony PURL.

421
00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:52.739
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Can do it, or at least the work is happening now.

422
00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:56.950
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): But it seems that today, right now, the

423
00:56:57.070 --> 00:57:00.409
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): public software or open source software.

424
00:57:01.697 --> 00:57:04.680
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): is maybe going to use Porl.

425
00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:11.870
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): But in proprietary software, that's not the default at this time.

426
00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:14.639
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Would that be a correct statement?

427
00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:27.770
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): I guess you know the question is, if purl in the future might be used everywhere, it might solve everything.

428
00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:34.319
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): But it sounds like today. It's not the the default for everything.

429
00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:43.930
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Thank you.

430
00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:50.540
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Well, I suppose our challenge then, will be to make the public call for comment.

431
00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:59.440
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): These topics common challenge and common ideas for solution.

432
00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:08.519
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): And this slide. By the way, Kuboto-san, thank you very much for outlining

433
00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:12.619
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): the type of actions that can be taken on source.

434
00:58:15.730 --> 00:58:21.250
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Which I will share this slide on the expo message later.

435
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:24.050
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Wonderful.

436
00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:43.880
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Are there any other? Comments or questions?

437
00:58:56.550 --> 00:58:57.590
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Nothing.

438
00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:10.350
Shane Coughlan (The Linux Foundation): Seems we might have reached the end of this meeting, which is good timing, because there's only 2 min and 30 seconds left.

439
00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:17.918
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, okay, thank you for joining today. And

440
00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:30.099
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): I will. Summarize this meeting today's meeting later, and you can leave us a meeting notes on the Github as a repository.

441
00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:34.209
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): And yeah, thank you very much.

00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:48.309
Nikola Babadzhanov (Bosch Digital): Thank you. Goodbye.

451
01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:05.210
Itaru Hosomi (NEC Corp.): Thank you.

452
01:00:13.650 --> 01:00:15.090
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): Yes, thank you. Shane.

453
01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.839

454
01:00:17.225 --> 01:00:18.380
Norio Kobota (Sony Group Corporation): No, no, no.

455
01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.356
